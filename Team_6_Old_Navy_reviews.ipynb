Three weeks later and another 20 minute call to \"service\" I was given two excuses (multiple choice?) That the package was damaged and they didn't have my address (agent two blamed agent one for typing it in incorrectly)No sincere apologies, no effort to make the moment right, no direct answers (nice script tho) and utterly shoddy effort.

Old Navy denied my claim because I previously had a missing item from an order last year. Is this a new tactic they have? To keep money for unsent items?I thought I was a decent enough customer that Old Navy would care that an item I paid for wasn't included in my order, but it seems this is not the case. Again, this is the second time this has happened to me. The first time, the item that was not included in my order was no longer available. In both instances, I was not looking for a refund, and would rather have the missing item sent to me, but Old Navy would rather keep my money and their item.

      "Review: My wife & I went to do a return at Old Navy. Since some items were passed the 30-day return window, we were offered a gift card instead. But we’re then told the return was declined & we had to call Return Activity Report. The return was over 30 days because their downtown store closed out, where we had tried the return a week earlier.At this point, my wife spoke with a very unpleasant old man named Ralph. He was clearly reading off a script and mumbling his words. When my wife, who is Colombian, got confused, he made racist comments to her. So we ended up making two different trips, out $200 bucks, and having to deal with a racist old man.\n",

      "Review: I went into the Pottstown location to make a purchase of wide leg jeans. While at the register the cashier asked if I would be interested in opening an old navy card stating I would receive 30% off my total purchase if I was approved. I agreed since I was informed it wouldn't be a hard pull on my credit not including this isn't my first old navy credit card(I didn't use the previous one so they closed the account). Well I put my information in and the price does on the register taking the 30% off my total purchase(that only happens when your approved) however the manager told me I wasn't, made it the original price while having words with me. I left the store just to get an email 10 minutes later that I was approved. I called store relations the next day and talked to a supervisor and was informed that I would receive a discount for a pair of jeans which is the total I was owed from the purchase I made in the store. It is now 30 days later & I still haven't received anything. I'm done with Old Navy treating certain customers like crap. This store doesn't deserve my money\n",

      "Review: The customer service agent who assisted me was great. I appreciate her help. Old Navy’s customer service policy, however, is very disappointing. I ordered a nursing cami and was instead sent a child’s outfit I did not order. Rather than putting the customer first and correcting the problem by resending me the item I originally ordered and telling me to keep the item Old Navy incorrectly sent me, Old Navy puts the entire burden of their mistake on the customer. Old Navy expects me to repackage and take to the post office an item they incorrectly sent me-which means I have to take time off work to get it to the post office during business hours. Then Old Navy wants me to call and jump through hoops to reorder the item I already ordered. Very, very disappointed in Old Navy’s policy. This situation is 100% Old Navy’s error & the onus to correct the company’s error should never be placed upon the customer.\n",

      "Review: In January I ordered 2 pair of joggers with matching tops, 4 items total & paid $113.64.  The items I ordered never arrived but they did send 1 black GAP T-shirt that I did not order.  Their tracking said my order was delivered.  It took 3 calls to customer service & a request for a manager to get a return label.  I returned the 1 GAP shirt I did not order but not really sure how one returns items they never received.  So now it’s March & I check tracking.  It states they received the package w/the shirt I never ordered & decide to issue a refund for 1 of the 4 items I never received.  The incompetence in their process is ridiculous.  So more calls to customer service tomorrow to try to get my money refunded for the items they never sent.  Never shopping at Old Navy again.  The entire process has been a disaster\n",

After that GAP didn't bother to send me email that the order was shipped back and even didn't bother to REFUND my money. So one month after they shipped the order back (and I was checking the tracking number meanwhile) I found out all of this. GAP customer support said they are sorry and offered 20% off for my next purchase! And that's not the end. I tried to apply 20% code for the next purchase and the code DIDN'T WORK.

I suspect this has been going on for awhile before I noticed as I place large orders and never looked through to itemize all things until it became obvious in an order that I was missing and charged for 4 items. After that I started to check all my orders and every month I have something missing that I was charged for. Usually they have refunded it but now I am missing an Easter shirt for my sons first Easter and they have refused to refund me for the shirt they never sent!! I have been contemplating no longer ordering because of this and can now say this has made that decision easy for me. I will no longer be ordering from old-navy, gap or any of their companies. They have scammed me and wasted my time having to keep contacting them over the same issue that I have asked them to escalate and look into their staff because this is clearly a problem.

      "Review: This company is horrible. I ordered items on December 10th and was supposed to receive them on the 16th. I called today and was the told that the package was given to someone to be delivered to the carrier and it never arrived. And that there was nothing they could do to re ship it even though someone stole it. The guy on the phone even told me that if I would have called a few day ago, they could have expedited the shipment because the policy had just changed. This isn’t the first time I’ve had this issue with this company and should have learned from the last time. Great customer service old navy.\n",

So my order arrives and the jeans are hideous and the leggings are very poor quality. So I take them to the store to get a refund. I get the receipt and she said my refund was $27.23....I walked outside and got to thinking that I know I paid more than that. I looked at my online receipt and sure enough it $32.60. So I go back in and I was told that I don't get reimbursed for shipping and handling. NOWHERE on their website does it say that you forfiet your S&H if you return in store. I'll never order online or ship in store again.\n",

      "Review: FIRST PROBLEM: I have an Old Navy Visa card in which I get reward dollars that I can use on purchases. This is the second time that I have caught them giving each reward dollars the same reward number so that only one can be used and the other just disappears, meaning I lose those reward dollars. I've probably lost out on other reward dollars and haven't noticed. SECOND PROBLEM: I've had multiple online orders where items have been removed because they are no longer available. Who's in charge of making sure they're not available BEFORE the purchase is made? THIRD PROBLEM: I emailed customer support and they sent an email back that \"We have received your email. Due to the unusually high volume of calls, we are unable to respond.\" So, they're not going to help me via email so I call wait 20 minutes for help. The gal that helped me was pretty distracted and didn't have any explanation regarding the problems. She did refund my order for the lost reward dollars, but didn't care to answer any other of my concerns about how Old Navy is currently running its business. On thing is for sure, my Old Navy Visa card will be cancelled and I never want to shop their again!\n",

It took exactly 5 weeks to arrive to my front door.  It was the same for my sister’s order around the same time.  I love their products and their prices, but they have to work on better delivery and keeping customers up to date on their orders.  The phone line was a joke. I waited 40mins and hung up.  For those people who haven’t received their orders after a month, I highly recommend you contact your bank or credit card to start a chargeback process.  They will need your order number and proof of email that it was shipped.  They will investigate and refund you the money that you cannot get ahold of old navy to.  But since my order came, I let my credit card company know to stop the chargeback.\n",

No where on their site does it mention the return time frame but I don't have a store close to me so I figured it wouldn't take long to get refunded since they aren't stating a time frame. I see my return was received on 3/29 per tracking it. On my online account it is not being updated to delivered and still showing as in transit and it is 4/2. I reach out through chat to question this and they just tell me refunds can take 15-20 days from when it's received and processed. Which, seems a bit long and if it takes this long that should DEFINITELY be disclosed somewhere on their site. So, since it is not even being updated on my account sounds like it will be close to a month before I even get my money back. I would have just made the drive to the Old Navy store that is an hour away if I would have known this ahead of time. The two different people I spoke with seemed like they just wanted to end the conversation and not assist me. Will not be ordering from Old Navy again.\n",

      "Review: I ordered online with Old Navy and for the most part I am satisfied with what I received.  I received $50 in Super Cash because of my shopping.My problem is having a timeline put on my Super Cash.  I was going to purchase winter clothing with my Super Cash in mid November but my Super Cash expires November 1st.  So my Super Cash will be invalid when I decide to shop at a time convenient to me.I have sent customer service an email with comments regarding their Super Cash program.  They responded by sending me an automatic email (heading:  Dear Valued Customer) giving me instructions for returns etc.  So this means that management does not view concerns from customers.  Is this because Old Navy is an American based company who only cares about profit and not the actual customer?  I am well aware of how profit works but there should be a balance between the customer and the company.  Valued customers should be more important to a huge corporation like Old Navy.As a result of this rating, I will not be shopping at Old Navy again and will pass on the word regarding my experience.\n",

So I was transferred to 'billing' who proceeded to tell me they couldn't help me and I would need to go to my credit card company and dispute. I told them it was THEIR CARD  I USED. But too bad I needed to go to Barclays and dispute the charge.  I've now spent at least 3 hours F*(&ing around with this for an item I didn't receive.

I chatted with a customer service rep who told me I had to reorder (not everything was available) and then once I did they could apply my rewards and ship it express.  I went though, got the stuff that was still there and then chatted again, this time the person told me that I would not get my rewards for one or two billing cycles, I guess that sounds so much better then 30-60 days.

Every time I have done so, I have been unable to sign into my account despite multiple attempts to change my password, switch to a different device, clear my cache, reboot my electronic device and call into customer service (who has never been able to rectify this situation).  I do not recall ever having been able to make an online purchase without having to do so as a guest. I can't even sign in on my Old Navy app because of this issue. I do not know if my points from my online purchases as a guest are actually added to my account because I cannot log into my account to view this.  I doubt it, as I have few (if any) points racked up to take advantage of when I have gone into an Old Navy store.  I am wondering if this is done intentionally to random people in order to make more money off of people who regularly spend money at Old Navy. Seems needless and really underhanded for a huge publicly traded corporation to stoop to such low levels to save a few bucks on ordinary, middle-income families.  The products themselves are of good quality otherwise I wouldn't continue to shop there.  This is just more than 5 years of frustration built up over an issue that should have been easy to solve.\n",

They were the holiday family pajamas, which are out of stock now, all varieties! This company doesn't seem to care that they sent the wrong items (twice) and I will most likely not be refunded the money due to the circumstances.  The customer service rep i spoke with could not refund my money unless the wrong items were returned via mail. A supervisor, with the power to do so, was conveniently not available.

But this time half the items were no longer available so I had to choose alternatives. Order went through no issue. 15 min later I receive an email saying my order has been flagged as fraud. It was canceled for the 8th time. A supervisor placed the order again and it went through. Guess what ? The clothes were terrible. I am now stuck with a 60 dollar gift card for a store that I want nothing from. I have ordered stuff 3 times and returned due to low quality each time.  I live on a very limited income and  cannot afford to waste 60 dollars. If Old Nay has accepted my debit/mastercard in the first place then the order would have been returned and I would have gotten a refund. Simple and normal. I have no idea why I was flagged as fraud. I am an old lady with no criminal activity in my life. A quick google search shows that this is an ongoing issue with old navy\n",

      "Review: I ordered the 2 day method b/c I was going on vacation three business days later. They use a variety of shippers apparently THOUGH on their website it states that they use UPS or Canada post (both which can do this service), therefore I felt confident in ordering with them. Old navy rep said they don’t know who they use until the order is shipped. Does this make sense? FedEx is notorious for not making an attempt at all.They just slap a sticker on our buzzer panel and leave. My manager of the building saw it! I had that happen previously from FedEx. I contacted FedEx regarding what happened, they denied the possibility that this might have ever happened. The location which is the pick up place is sitting at the edge of the North East end of town, a two hour bus ride and I couldn’t get the package for 3 business days which has a weekend in the middle. I am leaving Monday, July 5th and it was supposed to be at my place on June 30th. I told the rep I would never buy from there again, she didn’t care, or the obvious the company has no interest, I’m just one customer, what does that matter right? I demanded to talk with a manager after waiting a considerable amount time I didn’t get a manager which I’d asked for but I got a refund for the shipping. I shop on their website and I usually buy quite a lot at at one time. What a shame b/c I love their stuff. Bye!!\n",

      "Review: With Covid 19, influenza , RSV wrecking people’s lives right now, old navy shipped a piece of clothing that has an intense smell of cigarette smoke covered with this vomit 🤢 inducing body spray smell, with no tag to our home. Clearly, this piece of clothing has been worn, retuned then shipped to our home. Bag also has a “retouch tag/bin” sticker on it which distinctively shows that it was a returned item to old navy’s shipping center. It was mortifying and nerve wracking to open the shipping bag and be hit in the face/nose with that disgusting, horrendous smell. The bag had to be left outside for fear of what harm the smell could possibly do to our health and well being if left indoors. With no genuine apology given by the three customer service representatives that we spoke with… calls dropped/unable to hear the representatives, the resolution old navy gave us were: drive to UPS in the rain storms, drive to the store in the rain storms or mail the item back to old navy. All these options require a long waiting period before the refund can be processed. Reshipment of item was not offered.  For jeopardizing our safety and well being with the worn item they shipped to us, I was reluctantly offered 15% or 20% off coupon for future purchase which cannot be combined with any existing offers, which I politely declined. FYI: The only reason the 15% discount was offered was because I insisted on being compensated for our travel expense to and from UPS/a local store…#gasisexpensive#hellooldnavy. Either way, we have been inconvenienced by old navy’s incompetence and untrustworthiness. Why would I be excited about the 15% or 20% off coupon which cannot be combined with any other offers when currently they have 30% off discount including clearance on their website. Go figure!\n",

      "Review: If I could give no stars I would. Earlier this year when Walmart and ROSS were completely closed I bought a lot off Old Navy for myself, my boyfriend, and my mother. I waited a month patiently, and then my mother died of cancer. Yes, cancer, not covid. I track my package before the funeral and thankfully I hope I'll have pants to wear to her funeral. Wrong. Apparently the package came (as I'm at home) and because no one answered the door it was sent back? Yeah I was confused too. So, I sent an email to Old Navy explaining how I've waited OVER 2 months AND have already been billed. \"Your estimated response time is 3 days\". No response at all. I'm still waiting because well what can I do? Then, these morons have the nerve to charge another 100 to my account to which I sent another email and go no response...but I did get a refund. Its funny too because I'm waiting for my stuff and I get an email about how supposedly Old Navy has donated 30 million in clothes due to the situation with Covid. Couldn't laugh harder thinking how dumb that claim is when they can't even send out PAID for product. Do not waste your time. I hope this company goes belly up...should've been them first, not the mom and pop businesses.\n",

Now they were from size 5 to 14. Oh I firget to tell all supposedly everything in the store was 50 percent off. So you know my jaw dropped to the floor can you velieve those little lounge pants were 19.99 each I thought is was a darn joke but there ut was 20.00 for a pair of Pajama bottoms !! WTH is going on?? Then I realized that there was no black Friday sale.they just fixed the prices to where your paying regular prices anyway but wanted everyone to think they had 50 percent off. How horrible is that?? And Im curioys usnt that price gauging?? Im so disgusted to the point that when we pay off this credt card. I will be cutting into little pieces and never return to that Store.\n",

      "Review: I placed an order consisting of seven items with Old Navy as a gift for a loved one on September 19, 2020. The order's intended destination was Miami, Florida. I subsequently received confirmation that the items were split in two orders consisting of 5 items and 2 items respectively. According to UPS both orders were delivered at its intended address on September 25, 2020 within an hour of each other. The loved one received the order consisting of 5 items and did not received the other item. However, i just anticipated that it may have been delayed. When it wasn't delivered by October 10, 2020, i decided to reach out to a live chat agent at Old Navy and gave her the order number and particulars. The distasteful thing is that Old navy never reached out to me, however i was given a lame excuse that 'the item got losted in transit'. When i expressed that these two items were the favourite of the recipient i was informed that it is out of stock and all i can receive right now is a refund and discount on my next order. I was sent a confirmation email with the refund and insulted with a 15% discount on my next order with Old navy having been a long standing customer.No effort was made to retrieve or see whether the items are available at other branches/outlets at least in an effort to appease the customer.I have since deleted my old navy account and will no longer be shopping in store or online and won't encourage anyone to do so due to the lousy customer relation and uncaring attitude dispalyed. If i wasnt vigilant i would have been swindled of hard earned cashed.Goodbye Old Navy.\n",

      "Review: Avoid using Old Navy online if you don 't want to chance delivery issues! I bought a pair of jeans - JEANS - not some very expensive item that would normally require a signature. .UPS refused to leave them at the door, like normal shippers would, because according to them someone did not answer the door before 8am, on a weekend. They took them somewhere for \"pick up\". I do not want to inconvenience someone on my end to have to go pick up this item. I paid to have it SHIPPED not picked up. .I tried Old Navy's chat option to resolve this. Chat would not connect me with a human, and their AI was more artificial than intelligent. After a hide and seek session with their phone menu, I got a gal on the phone who hung up on me when trying to place me on hold. On my second calling attempt, I spoke with a guy who told me it is UPS' issue, not theirs. .I agree that UPS is HORRID but when ON chooses a shipper, they attach their customer experience to that shipper, so it should be their concern too. I could not get a human at UPS and was hung up on by their robot, right after she told me that they value my business. Oh the irony. .At this point, I plan to purchase a pair of jeans from a company that takes better care of their customers, and does not require a face-to-face delivery for a simple pair of pants. .This is extraordinarily bad business on so many levels. Including their response to my entering an after-call survey response of 0 on a scale of 0-10 regarding recommending their company to others... smart business would be to incorporate a policy of immediate follow up to make the customer who enters a 0 feel heard, and to resolve their issue. They did nothing of the kind. .Old Navy will get none of my business in the future, but they might want to hire me to help them create a better customer experience. Big box business or not, if you treat enough people poorly, you fold. Business is still personal.\n",

I bought some jeans there and returned a pair last week for a different size and they gave me another pair and I was out the door. I go back today and it’s totally different. Not only are they charging me extra because it was an online order. The girl at the register had the nerve to put the money on my visa and it’ll show up in a couple of days. Now I’m really angry because she’s returning my money to a card that has been terminated. So now I have to pay for them out of pocket and wait to get my money back. I’ve just had my bank destroy my card for fraudulent charges and that just happened a few days ago. Even Walmart  asks if you want a gift card, cash or Visa. Why didn’t she ask if I wanted a store credit or money or Visa and I could’ve explained.What’s the difference between last week and today. I wanted to jerk that bi***. I’m already upset about the Visa card now she wants to try some disrespectful reasons for doing this.. Then she had the nerve to say the customers are right but that’s our policy.What’s more important, customer satisfaction or manager satisfaction. The manager Christina has a very nasty don’t give a dam attitude but couldn’t tell me why I didn’t have to do this before. She said all the managers got together and decided on this policy….more BS!PLEASE REMEMBER CHRISTINA THE MANAGER SAYS WHEN YOU ORDER ONLINE AND DO AN INSTORE PICK UP YOU DONT GET AN EVEN EXCHANGE IF YOU RETURN ANYTHING. THEY NEED TO EXPLAIN THIS ON WEBSITE SOMEWHEREThey were acting like we’d stolen the damn jeans the receipt was in the bag at home but I had order, pickup number and receipt on my phone and that wasn’t good enough. ILL NEVER SHOP THERE OR ANY OLD NAVY UNTIL IM COMPENSATED AND TREATED WITH RESPECT BY THEIR MANAGEMENT…..,.PERIOD!I told her that I’m filing a complaint and she says I’ll give you the number as if to let me know she doesn’t care and isn’t worried because corporate won’t do anything.\n",

I used a gift card purchased from Rakuten, when LASERSHIP marked the 1st package delivered and then didn't deliver it, I called customer service they gave me a partial refund and refunded my GIFT CARD, SO I HAD TO ORDER AGAIN! I had no trouble getting into my account to order again but after that 2nd order I was never able to get back into my account! It kept rejecting my password and the password reset did't work so I had to get a temporary password from customer service.  It happened again and I stopped trying to get in, now I know why they didn't want me to get back, I would have known that the items they were sending me were not what I ordered! I ordered foil dotted leggings and a loose sweatshirt in larger size than usual! More on that later, the 2nd package delivery was worse than the 1st. It went UPS MAIL INNOVATIONS, should just be called: HOW TO SCREW UP A CUSTOMER'S LIFE! It left by plane from California on the 18th, and landed in Northern Ohio(I live in Ohio) it went to Michigan, then it went to Pennsylvania(you have to go through Ohio to get to Pittsburgh) it arrived on the 27th! I wish it had never arrived because the sweatshirt that was a 2X(a size up from my usual 1X) was so tight I had to get it off me, and the tiedye was so embarrassing, it said it was specially made, for who a HOOKER? The breast areas have  tie dye explosive circles around each breast! Now to what were supposed to be leggings, they were pants with a tight high waist, a zipper with slide clips and short pockets(what's the use of having pockets if you couldn't ever use them as pockets) not to mention they looked really really old, like they had been stored in that bag for a really really long time? Both bags had been opened and badly retaped, so somebody else hated them too! Now, I ask you, can I return this crap, NO because they will refund my gift card again, like I want to order anything else? I can't return it to a store because they don't put receipts in the bag and their emails have red letters spelling out that you can't use the emails as a receipt! So I took a trash bag out and I'm starting a Goodwill bag, maybe a thrifty street walker will be able to use both those items, I just want them outta my house! I CAN'T GIVE THEM NO STARS BUT I REALLY WANT TO GIVE THEM LESS THAN NO STARS, customer service is way bad too, don't go there. They need to punt, either totally reboot the system or go out of business.\n",

Meanwhile the order has NOT shipped, as the shipping company has not even received the package yet. This is simply a way to take your money without providing the service.\n",

The other hasn't even been received by UPS, according to their tracking number, though it's been ready to ship since 06-15.(interesting how 1 of the 2 packages ready the same day made it to UPS...) It's now 07-09. Emailed customer service, reply received indicates they aren't responding to emails and to call their line. So called the line on multiple occasions, only to sit on hold with no response. Absolutely unacceptable.

None of them looked as advertised, and many people on social media were complaining about the same thing. I called one evening and after being on hold an hour and a half, a woman tells me that they are aware there is a problem not only with the masks but with the wait time. She asks me to hold on a minute, puts me back in the damn que, and after being on hold another hour, I hung up. Called back again today and was on hold for TWO HOURS AND 17 MINUTES. The lady apologized for the hold, told me the packages were labeled a \"surprise\" and offered me 15% off my next purchase. MY NEXT PURCHASE? I am NEVER doing business with Old Navy again. Horrible customer service and horrible product. Just a note, they tried to blame the pandemic for the long wait times.

      "Review: Old Navy seems to be the only company experiencing “delays” with UPS    I’ve been receiving other packages from them in record time.  By the time I get what I ordered from Old Navy, IF I ever get them, summer will be over    I’ve emailed numerous times only to get an automated reply 5 DAYS LATER with the same excuse.  Tried calling but after waiting an hour on line it gets old.  Hard to believe UPS is giving great service to other businesses except Old Navy.  Why would that be?   I’ve been charged for 3 orders that have been placed a month ago that still have not been picked up.     I would like my orders cancelled but that’s unlikely to happen since it’s not Old Navy's problem.  I’m sure other customers would love to see them go out to their pick up container and retrieve their parcels as well.  Perhaps if They are blaming UPS they should focus on customer service and ship through a different carrier.  A coworker of mine placed an order 3 weeks after me and received her order last week.\n",

I called them up 3 times for around 30 minutes and they're just not answering. So I decided to call today June 19th at 7 am Sharp, which Is when they're supposedly starting to work and so far I've been waiting for 45 minutes. Horrible  customer service. There Is a recording at the beginning of the conversation that says something like \"because we are in the covid frontlines we aré very busy\" or some bull like that. I didn't know that Old Navy was an hospital and the employees were doctors. What a joke\n",

      "Review: Ordered a few things over a three week period. I quickly received a “order shipped” email with tracking number. None of the packages have been beyond label creation. Managed to talk to a customer service rep, who was rude and basically called me a liar for saying my packages aren’t being shipped. Only willing to send me a shipping labels which will re charge me if items aren’t returned in 30 days... basically telling me I will get charged twice for items that aren’t being sent. If there is a problem with shipping, be upfront. Rule number one of customer service. COMMUNICATE! And stop sending the how is your item? Give us a review emails if there is a problem!!Funny how the one gap item I ordered at the same time showed up in 10days. Giving them one more week then I will start a claim with my credit card. Extremely disappointed at the duration and quite angry at the poor handling of the situation.\n",

To add insult to injury, they send me emails almost daily asking me to review the items I ordered but never received.

After expressing what I thought they should do the supervisor hang up on me. I wanted them to make it right. I will not shop at old dirty navy anymore neither will my daughter. They gave me a code for twenty percent off. And after going in circles with the supervisor I got six dollars and fifty cents off the masks.

      "Review: I have ordered on this website before and have had no issues in the past but lately it’s been very disappointing! I placed an order on May 26th (a fairly large order, about 16 items), I went with the no rush shipping because it said I would still get my items by June 16th and part of the order was for my daughters birthday which is on the 23rd so I wasn’t concerned. A week after I placed the order I got an email saying 4 items were not available so they would be removed from my order...ok not a huge deal. Then my order sat with no shipping notification and in the meantime I had some old navy cash and a 10% off coupon that I received for my cancelled items so I thought I would order my nephew some clothes for his bday. I placed that order at the beginning of June (again with no rush shipping) and it had all shipped within a week and is already being delivered! So I was concerned my order got misplaced so I sent an email, no response and called on Friday. I got through right away and the guy was super nice but felt like he was giving me some bs about how some items can’t be shipped to Box numbers so that is why they are cancelled..don’t really believe that but whatever. Anyways my order said it would still arrive on time (June 16th) and it is now the 13th and it hasn’t shipped yet (there is no way it’s arriving on time at thus point) and now tonight I got 2 separate emails that 2 more items were no longer available! So I’m down to maybe getting 10 of my 16 items, we will see what the actual number is once this order actually ships!! Totally disappointed as I feel as though this order was missed being fulfilled.\n",

      "Review: The website is a nightmare. SLOW. The screens move around on their own and flash to different screens making it difficult if not impossible to use. No customer should need to endure this and need that much patience to order. The cart removes items that sell out but does not notify the buyer in any way. Things are in your cart and then they are gone with no notice, just deleted. The shipping is ridiculous. Slow.  Items are shipped from different places , store stock perhaps, so it is very hard to track if and when your items arrive and if the order is complete. I placed an order which took hours to place and I had to take a break between browsing sessions because the site is so frustrating to use. I actually had to place two orders because thing in the cart disappeared so I had to try to remember what they were and go back to try for different sizes or alternatives. 22 days after my order was placed I got two emails telling me that 39 individual items that I bought were not able to be shipped. Yeah, 39 things I bought are not ever coming. I heard nothing for 22 days!!! But don't worry they gave me a 10% off coupon for next time. I have ordered tons of stuff online since the shelter-in-place order and none have been late, or canceled. Amazon has been slow running a few days to a week slower than normal, but old Navy has really taken it to the next level. The Clothes are okay for the money usually but it is not worth the tax on your life force!!! Save yourself the aggravation and shop anywhere else.\n",

I was left confused if my cancellation was processed. I did check the following day on the order status through phone (an automated prerecorded procudure), and it was cancel! (THANK GOODNESS) To be honest, Old Navy is never really on my list of stores that I go to because of their style and weird sizing, before covid I did pick up a cute pink corduroy jacket, quality was good. But it was a really out of the blue purchase, saw it at the store front when I passed by. My last purchase before this was probably .....10+ years ago?

I put my address in the system took my apt. number out I called customer service was on hold for more than 4 hours spoke to two representatives and one supervisor who all told me something different. They didn't help me at all. I still don't know if the order is canceled nor did they give me my money back. I called my bank amd disputed the action. Ridiculous. They are THE WORST COMPANY TO DEAL WITH AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY NEED NEW POLICIES AND WORKERS. RUN RUN RUN NEVER ORDER FROM THEM.\n",

I've emailed them 6 times and get a response that my email will be replied to in 3 business days.... i haven't heard anything back in over a month. Meanwhile I'm left with someone else's order and continue to get emails from Old Navy advertising more sales!!!!! STOP ADVERTISING IF YOU CAN'T CARE FOR THE CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED AND HAVE ISSUES. Would give ZERO stars if I could. This is UNREAL. Its incredible to me that I can order something from a small business (or any other name brand companies) and get everything sent on time and correctly and this MAJOR company cant figure anything out.

Called the day before and spoke to a man who assured me my order would be cancelled. Then received an email the next day that it was shipped and I was charged the full shipping amount.

STOP OFFERING A DELIVERY SERVICE ON YOUR WEBSITE!!! Especially if you are going to treat customers like this, because I have placed orders with other companies and I have received my orders within a weeks time some of them 2 weeks time. How can a large company like Old Navy not be able to fulfill an order??? I will wait for this order (that once again was supposed to be delivered by 5/23/2020 by the way), but after this I will never shop with you guys ever again. I will find another brand of jeans.

In the meantime (in between the 30 days I had been waiting) I had placed other orders online Bc of super cash and such. Before I knew it my card had $899 worth of charges to it!! I finally reached out on a social media page to them and finally got a response THROUGH TEXT! No one has tried to call or actually understand the true chaos that this has been or understand what actually happened! nor do they seem to care! 1 package was missing 4 ITEMS and another package I tried to return won’t let me print a return label Bc it stated “ item has not shipped” yet I’m looking at the charge on my card!

The second time I spoke to the same lady I have spoken to previously which was on 04/17/2020 Friday at 8:37PM this lady made my whole experience impossible for me everything was so negative about her I was able to pick up on her attitude as well. Well today 04/23/2020 at 9pm I called and that same negative lady answered and all I wanted was to try to switch one of my items to a different color (that was just placed not even shipped) and there again everything so impossible with a negative attitude. So I asked to speak to a supervisor before he got on the line his name was Ryan he laughed and answered. I explained the situation but him again making everything in possible. I asked him so if I were to go to the store in person and tell the worker can you please remove this item I can’t afford it she won’t be able to do it and he said “no they’ll tell you the same.” He gave me the same energy the lady gave me and I told him I don’t appreciate your attitude And he changed his voice tone and I informed him just because you change your voice tone it doesn’t mean your not giving me an attitude I have been working in customer service for many years. My point is I would have liked if someone were to explain to me or say to me “I’m extremely sorry but our system won’t allow us to.” Instead of saying “No I can’t do that for you once it’s done it’s done.” I rarely place reviews anywhere but this really disappointed me I was a loyal shopper at Old Navy I’m for sure not shopping here again.\n",

Of course I got $200 plu because I love there clothing  and discounts\n",

My second order shipped the next day with a tracking number and received in 4 days. My first order has yet to process or ship. Free 5-7 business days shipping is not true! I’ve spoke to a rep and he beat around the bush and could not answer a single question. I asked to speak to a supervisor who had a poor attitude and pretty much told me this is the way it is. Not helpful and could not answer any of my questions as why either. Will this business suffer if they lose my business? No not at all. Do they care about their customers? No not at all. Do they offer good prices? Yes they do. But I have zero problem spending more money on clothing and supporting businesses that keep their word and value their customers. Oh I’m sorry the supervisor did offer to replace this order tonight and have it overnighted at no cost but could not guarantee he could cancel my other order. So another words double charge me and me have to take time out of my day to fix their issue in returning and going through that hassle. If I wanted to deal with that I would’ve gone in the store and made my purchase. When I told the supervisor that I will making my very first review about a company his words whatever have a nice day!\n",

      "Title: WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!\n",
      "Review: I have been shopping at Old Navy for over 25 years.  I have a credit card with their company and have for years.  I have done most of my clothing shopping for my five kids, and now their spouses.  Well I went in August to buy matching clothes for my whole family (9 people) for family pictures.  I spent over $700 that day.  I went in last week to return 2 pair of jeans and 4 blouses that didn't work, and all of them were unworn with tags still on them.  I had my original receipt.  The lady at the register told me since it had been over 45 days, she had to give me the sale price.  I told her that was fine, and asked why it wasn't 90 days like it was in the past, but that I understood the policy.  Then she said she could only give me in store credit, and again I said it was fine, even though I would have preferred credit back to my Old Navy card.  Then she rang it all up, and it came to just over a hundred dollars.  She put the clothes behind her and then turned to give me my receipt and she said, \"Oh I'm sorry, your return has been rejected.\"  I asked her why and she said I would have to call the company on the receipt and there was nothing she could do.  So I had her gather the clothes up and I left.  I had other errands to run and so I called while I was driving around.  I was on hold with that company for 47 minutes.  When the man finally answered, he asked for the transaction ID number.  I gave it to him 4 times and he said there wasn't anything under that number.  So he asked for my license, and he said the same thing.  He said I had to go to the customer service counter at Old Navy itself to resolve it.  At that point I couldn't get back to Old Navy before it closed so I went again tonight.  I explained to the girl at the register what had happened and asked if there was anything I could do to return the clothes.  She said, \"we can just return them as if you didn't have your receipt.\"  Odd, because I did, but I said that was fine, please just return them.  So she rung them all up and asked for my license.  So I said, is my license going to be attached to the last time I tried to return them?  And she said No.  But sure enough, it was, so my return was rejected again.  She called her manager and he said there isn't anything he can do, apparently my license has locked me from being able to return anything at Old Navy because I keep trying without my receipt.  I am livid.  I have never returned anything there without a receipt, AND they can look it up on my credit card statement.  So now I have a bag full of clothes that don't fit, and Old Navy employees and managers that said it's out of their hands.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE in the world!  Those clothes are still hanging in their store, they are from less than 2 months ago, not 2 years ago.  To top it off, I went tonight to return a pair of jeans to American Eagle that I also bought on picture day and they happily gave me my money back.  And then to JC Penney to return two shirts from the same day, and they happily returned those as well.  If I could give Old Navy zero stars, I would.  I am SO disappointed by the way I was treated in both stores and I'll do everything in my power to convince everyone I know to never set foot in another Old Navy again.\n",

Not only is everything late, the new shipment doesn’t include 3 items that I had originally ordered and I have yet to be reimbursed and when I ask about how I will be reimbursed, I am ignored.
