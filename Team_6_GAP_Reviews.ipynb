      "Review: Horrible service when it comes to delivery.  I’d placed an online order and it was returned due to insufficient address.  They forgot to enter my apt # and this is the second time it has happened.  Now I have to call shipping to track down the order and update my address?  I don’t think so!  I’ll be calling customer service to vent tomorrow!  How do they expect to stay in business and compete with companies like Amazon is beyond me!  I’d love to support small businesses and other businesses that serve middle class customers, but they need to fix their internal issues or they’ll go extinct!\n",

The other two items I wished to exchange for other items (not get money back) but I was told too bad it's past the 30 days no exceptions. I have had some family issues, and they were a little more important than remembering to exchange items within the 30 days, but the gentleman I spoke with didn't care. 'You are out of the 30 day exchange period, nothing we can do'I guess they truly care about their customers..I will not be shopping with them.\n",

They put it through at full price until challenged - that's their job, surely they should be able to do it without the customer having to make sure there's no overcharge?Secondly, the $29.95 orange sticker T-shirt, when we peeled back the sticker, was originally $17.95. So, GAP are marking up to make back down, if they remember to reduce it as they say they will. No wonder the stores are in financial trouble. Apart from one more visit to return the fraudulently priced item, that'll be the last time we go there.\n",

Why would you have a customer service if you can't help someone?  I personally would not ship with any carrier that I could not track.

I received several packages as the order was split (worst idea). I kept looking thinking my item would arrive... two days ago I sat at my computer and went back online - checked my order to see if I had really placed the order or it was shipped separately. Gap is showing the item shipped but I never received the item in the package. I called. They said they were out of stock. I however need to contact my credit card company and dispute the missing item. I found that very distasteful and fraud. My credit card company had nothing to do with the order. Gap got paid for something they never delivered. Gap stores too. Unhelpful associates and management. Never going back.\n",

By the 21st, UPS noted to file a claim and that it was just not available to be delivered. That's odd. But, Gap Outlet refused to pay me a full refund for the $5 shipping. So, I got $52 instead of $57+ for a refund. I would add photos\n",

I thought to myself that I would have plenty of time after returning from the trip to return my order and did not make that the focus while trying to get ready. I learned today that Gap's shipment policy is 30 days from shipment date and not delivery date, so I missed the window for returns of items that don't fit me. For what it's worth, I ordered on May 31 and received on June 6. Since some orders take up to ten days to receive (and probably will be longer if the UPS strike occurs in August), I just don't find this a fair policy or one that is the norm. I imagine I'm not the only one who relied on consumers norms and got burned. For that reason and a few others not mentioned here, I will not be ordering from Gap again.

Store at Stonebriar refused to take return at all . Why can’t they give store credit or an exchange ?Then called online and they said I could exchange . So went to another store at Preston , While they gave store credit for one order but for the other which was also late they said they can give only 50% of it WHY???? I am taking store credit why half on one and not on other . Don’t do online shoppers from GAP unless you are absolutely sure.\n",

      "Review: Terrible Experience, Never Received My OrderI recently placed an order with GAP totaling $132.00, and unfortunately, it has been an absolute nightmare dealing with their customer service. Despite paying for my merchandise, I never received it.Firstly, the shipping process was excruciatingly slow. Weeks went by, and there was still no sign of my package. When I reached out to customer service for assistance, they were unhelpful and seemed indifferent to my situation.After multiple attempts to track down my order, all I received were generic responses and empty promises of investigation. It's clear that GAP lacks the basic courtesy of keeping their customers informed and addressing their concerns promptly.As if that wasn't frustrating enough, the lack of accountability is appalling. Not only did I not receive my merchandise, but GAP also failed to offer any compensation or resolution for the inconvenience caused.I expected better from a company of GAP's reputation. This experience has left me deeply disappointed and frustrated. I strongly advise against shopping with GAP if you value your time and money.Save yourself the hassle and shop elsewhere.\n",

      "Review: Dear Gap, when you send a customer the wrong item then YOU should correct it, not leave it to the paying customer to go and do your bidding while standing in line at the post office or store to return your mistake before you will even send the correct item.  Send a return label with the correct item and make it easy on the customer.  The shipping label doesn’t even have the correct item on it.  I’m too exhausted to call your customer service back and explain to them how your trading has failed them that I will simply be disputing the charges.  If people are ordering online it is because they don’t have time to stand in line for you, or shop at the store.  This is not genius but you do need some genius because from reading the other reviews it is obvious that whom ever is in charge of your customer service practices should be fired.  A long going issue at this point.... while others are catering to online services during COVID Gap remains stagnant and ignorant of good service and reputation.\n",

The moron on the phone kept me on hold for almost 30 minutes back and forth before admitting that he could do nothing about gift cards.  He then stated that the balance was my loss.  I demanded to speak to a supervisor, who (after another 30 minutes on the phone) agreed to issue a new card.  Of course, he made an error and instead of issuing an e-card he sent a new plastic card via UPS.  It never arrived.  After two weeks I initiated a chat to demand a replacement.  Customer service kept me on chat for an HOUR only to admit they would have to 'forward' the info to the gift card department for resolution.  They said I could copy the chat once we disconnected as proof, but it disappeared as soon as they did.  I called back on the phone and demanded to speak to a supervisor.  Because I was angry, the rep had the nerve to tell me that I was acting \"unprofessionally\" - as if they had done anything but.

I tried contacting customer support about this, but after several minutes of non-answers I started the process of closing my account out of concern that someone had accessed it. (This is not an easy process and I don't trust that it's been completed.)Several hours later I received an email that a technical error meant the order wasn't available and that they cancelled the order on our behalf. The email was written as if it effected more than just me. I'm not sure why they feel that 10% off an order that will likely not arrive in Christmas is an appropriate response to this mistake, especially when I had almost an entire month I could have shopped elsewhere if they had let us know about this \"technical mistake\" earlier. The quality of their clothes are barely worth the price (and never worth full price) and they are definitely not worth the headache.\n",

I guess the thought never crossed their mind to ring the bell either. I reached out to LaserShip & they did nothing but tell me to contact Gap so I did.  I then did research on this 3rd party courier only to see that the reviews are HORRIBLE which explains the issue I’m having along with others. Gap hasn’t done anything to resolve or accommodate me as the customer because they continue to use them as a courier. Moral of the story is moving forward I will no longer patronize the Gap because I’m out of money & merchandise and they still got paid so they’re winning the couriers who are stealing is getting paid to deliver “BUT AREN’T” & is getting the merchandise the customers have paid for!!!

I called customer service and was told both that the items were delivered and that the items would be delivered by 12/14. I was told to wait and if I didn't get the package by 12/15 to call back for a refund. Not satisfied with this response I checked with the delivery agent (UPS). Their on-line tracking shows that the package was indeed delivered on 11/30 but to a guy named Steve at his house. I have his address and the only thing it has in common with mine is that it is in the same state. So I called customer service again to tell them that there is no sense in my waiting for a package that Steve is now enjoying and to ask for a refund. I was again told that their system will not allow a refund to be processed until December 15th. I filed a lost package complaint with UPS and will see which corporate giant resolves this matter quicker. In the meantime, I'll do the rest of my Christmas gift shopping in brick and mortar small local businesses.\n",

They finally sent the packages and the order was wrong. I ordered three shirts and they sent one and the shirt they sent was the wrong size!  I called them to rectify the situation and got a very rude CSR who lied about issuing a refund for the missing shirts and then made me give my credit card to re-order them.  AGAIN. Come to find out they never issued a refund for the missing shirts, they just charged me again for more shirts.  The absolute worst customer service with a language barrier that only exacerbates the situation.  I disputed the charges on my credit card because after two phone calls to Customer Service, all I got was more lies and no resolution.  The Gap online SUCKS!!

      "Review: As a lifelong Gap shopper, I'm super disappointed to be writing this review. I purchased two dresses online to choose one for an upcoming wedding. They arrived on separate days. The Gap has changed its return policy to 30 days FROM the SHIP DATE! One of the dresses took 15 days to arrive, and I shipped it back to the GAP within 48 hours. It also took another 15 days to get to their warehouse - using the return label that they generated for me. They refused to take it back and shipped it back to me with a note that said they received it after their 30-day window. Considering 30 days was *literally* spent shipping, I am now stuck with a $100 dress that does not fit me right. I reached out to customer service, and they gave me 20% off my next purchase. This was during the pandemic when everything was being delayed with shipping - and my family and I had COVID when it arrived, so I could NOT actually return it to the store. (It seems like during this time of such upheaval, you'd be considerate of your customers - and at least offer store credit if you are going to change your return policy so drastically.) Long story short - I cut all my credit cards up and have boycotted them all together.\n",

The Lasership company uses local delivery people who drive their own personal cars with no signage or marking that this is a delivery company, the cars creep around the neighborhood looking for the right house and then a random person gets out with no name tag or credential badge on and tosses the package onto the porch. This has happened multiple times and I have observed this in person. The latest situation happened yesterday and led me to plead with the Gap to re examine who they use as a shipping vendor. A white mini van creeped on my house then parked at the end of my driveway and a little boy approx 9 or 10 years old got out of the van holding a gap package and proceeded to walk up the driveway. I thought perhaps my package had been delivered to the wrong house and he was just bringing it by, when I asked him he said no, my mom drives me around and I run the packages to the house. This is just awful. Hmmmm the Gap prides itself on doing the right thing for women and children and the environment and under developed countries but this is the worst, child labor! I have tried complaining to the Gap and was offered a 10% discount code for my troubles. I refused that because I don't want to be pacified, I want to know they are going to fix this!!!

      "Title: I paid $250 for 8 items for my daughter…\n",
      "Review: I paid $250 for 8 items for my daughter from the Athleta Store (a division of the GAP), however, the size match-up was way off and I had to return all the items for a simple exchange from Medium to Large. That's it! Very simple, easy? NOPE!. I do this all the time with Adidas, Under-Armour, and other stores, and the exchanged items size are often shipped out immediately on confirmation of the returned items with those stores (I returned a top to UA the same day with the GAP/Athleta items, and I am receiving the replaced item in the same week). The 8 items I returned to Athleta were delivered within 3 business days, and I was told that it will take 7-10 business days to process and then the exchanged items will be shipped out, thus, meaning it will take at least 3-4 weeks to receive the corrected/exchanged size unless I paid to place another order for the same items (with corrected size) while the returned items are being processed, thus, tying up $500 of my money. That is insane and very backward. Not only such, but they are also very misleading in their size analysis, my daughter wears a medium from every other brand except this one. By the time this is processed, it's very unlikely I will be able to re-purchase the correct size items. What a horrible experience.\n",

      "Review: I have two kids and shop gap a lot.  Mostly early morning when am up to feed the bay, On their website it says free shipping over $50. Each time I have spend over 100 plus and shop gap 1-2 times a month. I never realize I have to go in myself and pick free shipping. I just click apple pay double click the button and done. I called for a shipping refund and the lady over the phone was VERY rude and was giving me attitude. Not sure I will be shopping gap online anytime soon . They should have it like Nordstrom , Bloomingdales, macys and Nordstrom Rack where you just get your free shipping once you go over the $50. When you are a busy mom , you don't have the time to check all the details. I am just trying to shop the fastest and easiest way I can.  I spend a lot of money on gap items online and now, I will most likely take my money else where. I wish I held on to all my email recites\n",

      "Review: I don’t know what happened to your customer service but it is AWFUL!I tried to return an item at 30 days and was told no because it had to be received by 30 days. Seriously??So my 30 days begins when it is marked shipped. That was on a Saturday and it did not move until Tuesday. I received Friday so that’s 7 days of my 30 days. I then need to allow for a week for you to receive it…so another 7 days. You also changed your return policy with zero effort to inform your loyal online shoppers. Unless you went in to read the return policy (and who does that when they have been ordering from gap for decades), you were blindly unaware until you tried to make a return and were told “TOO BAD NO EXCEPTIONS”. Wouldn’t even give me a gift card. I think I’ll give my business to Marks….they have a 100 day return policy. And guess what?? If you return after that….they will give you a gift card!!! Wow, What a concept!\n",

      "Title: Shocked by the Negative Reviews!\n",
      "Review: Very shocked by all the negative reviews! I've purchased from GAP, Athleta, Banana Republic and Old Navy for years with no problems. Just two months ago, I made a huge order between all 4 brands and returned a lot of stuff to back. All the returns were accepted in a reasonable amount of time and I got refunds for every package.I find the quality of clothes from all the brands to be pretty sufficient for the prices being charged. I mostly love Athleta's style.Lastly, I recommend staying away from buying the YZY collab hoodie. While I've always enjoyed purchasing from GAP and the other brands, fast shipping, fast returns and never had problems, I can't say the same for their YZY merchandise. I ordered the hoodie for someone and it took 2 months to arrive. The quality was like Walmart quality, not very creative, the back of the hoodie was plain, it was $10 shipping, fit way too small, and lastly, if you try to return it to a GAP store, they won't take it. Apparently, it's shipped by a third-party merchant who prints the hoodies, not GAP. That would explain the poor quality and why a $90 hoodie cos $10 to ship when GAP normally gives free shipping after $50. If you try to return it online, you basically go through a headache trying to hound for an answer since the package comes with no invoice or any return labels.Overall, I've had pretty good experiences with GAP (and other brands) so that's why I gave them a 5-star. They could mess up here and there but they never gave me major problems.\n",

      "Title: BE AWARE! Return policy is a SCAM\n",
      "Review: BE AWARE!! - Their online return policy on all GAP-GAP FACTORY-OLD NAVY is a complete SCAM! You have 30 days from SHIPMENT date to have your returned package ARRIVE to their warehouse! And it can take up to 15 days for it to arrive!!! This means that you basically really have just 15 days from the day your order will be shipped to you to the day you make the return. Assuming that the original order might take up to 7 days to arrive to you, you only have about 8 days to decide if you are keeping the items or not. Good luck!!I spoke with a customer service agent on June 20th for an order that was placed on May 28th and he told me that if I mail my package today it's not sure it will arrive by June28th at the warehouse as it might take up to 15 days, so if it doesn't arrive on time the return of 150$ won't be accepted!! But he said: \" I'd suggest you try to make the return and STAY POSITIVE!!!\" wow...!! This really is a scam..He also suggested that I return my items in store as that would be the safest way to make sure my return is accepted. The order includes both old navy and gap items and to return it I'd have to go to both stores because they wouldn't process it just in one of them! For a company as major as GAP INC you would expect a more professional and respectful policy towards customers...\n",

      "Title: Delayed Shipping…\n",
      "Review: I have never shopped Gap online or in store prior to a few weeks ago. I ordered some baby items online (matching bodysuits and pants). I also ordered a few Old Navy items at the same time, since it's a joint website. The items from Old Navy arrived in two days and all together, neatly wrapped and packaged, obviously from a fulfillment center. The items from Gap (according to tracking info) were sent separately, apparently from various stores (had I known this I wouldn't have ordered). The shipping said they would arrive in 3-5 business days. I received several separate emails regarding the individual items saying \"we're so sorry for the delay, but we don't know when your item will arrive\" and another that said \"awaiting cancellation\". On EVERY item I ordered from Gap. So, I called. The item \"awaiting cancellation\" wasn't available. Ok fine, then please don't send me the matching pants. Well, that's not possible, but you can send them back for a refund. Two of the items eventually arrived and were obviously someone's return, no tags and dirty. So, I returned all three of these items via their express returns at Staples (we do not have a Gap store nearby), and two weeks later, no refund yet. The last item still hasn't made it. It was supposed to arrive on Feb. 3, but now has a date of Feb. 9. They did refund that item since it doesn't appear to actually be moving away from where it was sent and towards it's destination, per tracking. Overall, I'm still stuck with half outfits due to items not being available or having not arrived. I will NEVER order from Gap again. I was offered a 15% off coupon to compensate, however I declined because all the frustration is simply not worth it. All the bad reviews I've read seem to deal with this same issue.\n",

      "Review: I ordered 3 jackets and a hat on Nov. 29, 2021. I received that order on Dec. 4, 2021. One of the jackets I ordered was missing out of the package and there was a pair of joggers I didn’t order inside instead. I contacted gap customer service and was suppose to be emailed a return label and a discount code for my next purchase and I was told I would receive my refund in 3-5 business days. That email never showed up so I had to call back and explain that whole situation again! This time I was sent a return label and the discount code, that I tried to use to reorder the same jacket but it did not work. Also, on this call the customer service rep said it would be 10 business days for my refund. I mailed off the item that was sent accidentally, not my fault, it was their mistake. I waited the allotted time and still no refund. I waited a couple of days, called again and now I was being told 15 business days and they have record of the mistaken item being received at their dock on Dec. 16, 2021. Now I’m getting frustrated. I then called again after the winter break in January 2022 and this time I’m being told 20 business days plus an additional 3-5 business days for my refund to hit my account. Now it’s January 18, 2022 and I still have not received my refund. I have never dealt with this kind of issue with gap. They have outsourced their customer service and it has went down hill tremendously! If you check their reviews and complaints on BBB, you will see so many people having the same issue when it comes to refunds from Gap inc.\n",

I said I was home solo because my husband is on a temporary deployment, with 3 sick kids (one of which had Covid, Flu, and Strep), and the UPS store was a 30 minute round trip away. I asked them to have the order picked up by UPS or send a prepaid polymailer for me to send from my mailbox.They said “no” multiple times and just ignored my request for them to find a solution that didn’t require me leaving the house. Keep in mind these were NOT items I ordered! They sent me a box of items by mistake! The items had nothing to do with me!!This was their response “… Although we are unable to schedule a UPS pick up to your location, we would like to offer that you can return the items whenever you have any free time. Sometimes our customers will tell us they can return packages to a UPS store or Gap store whenever they are in that area for shopping or other errands and that is perfectly ok. We don't want to force you to leave the house just for one task or cause any stress whatsoever. We understand that now is a burdensome time to do so.Given the situation, we as individuals would feel the same way. Please take your time, there is no rush. If you could, please let us know what the original order number was. We can leave accurate notes for this case and track the error on our part so something like this doesn't happen again.”Free time? Free time?!! Who are they to feel so entitled to my free time. I rarely have free time, but when I do I’m supposed to donate it to them and run their errands??Garbage company.\n",

      "Review: I ordered a few hundred dollars worth of merchandise and Gap/OLDNAVY split the order up: 1 shipment with 14 items, 1 shipment with 1 item (a shirt). LASERSHIP is their preferred free shipping service. Almost immediately it showed shipment 1 as 'DAMAGED and UNDELIVERABLE, contact the shipper'. I contacted LASERSHIP many times with no reply and couldn't speak to a live person. They sent two standard canned responses but never followed up. GAP/OLD NAVY customer service would NOT give me a refund nor make good on the order by sending a replacement order. They said I would have to wait until the listed shipping date passed before they would give a refund. Never mind that not one person could tell me what happened to my package. Most of my experience with normal trusted shippers, not these lowest rated shippers in the USA called LASERSHIP, involved them always delivering a package even with damage. What exactly happened to a box of clothes that made it so damaged it couldn't be delivered? Destroyed in a fire? Water damage? Theft? Who knows?! GAP/OLDNAVY didn't care, only sent an email to LASERSHIP with no followup to me as promised! So me a customer left in the dark, money left on 'hold'. OR did GAP/OLDNAVY damage the package??!! WHO KNOWS??!! LASERSHIP amazingly did get the one shirt delivered on time!! WOW!!!! Imagine them doing their jobs! The bulk of the order, the other package deemed 'DAMAGED & UNDELIVERABLE' was sent back to the GAP by LASERSHIP and never to me. I called and got the refund after the shipping date passed and I didn't receive anything, although it took a few days to process. RUN from the GAP, OLDNAVY, BANANA REPUBLIC!!! If you do order from them, don't use their FREE SHIPPING if it's only with LASERSHIP! Use UPS or FEDEX IF they offer it! I will never shop at these stores again!

The shipping had said 7-9 business days so I proceeded to buy it .I had a certain day specific I wanted to wear this item .The day of receiving came and no order came through so as a concerned customer I log in to check my order it turns out it had been updated here I am a bit bummed out it is just a coat after all hmm I’ll perhaps give it some extra time until the next shipping date . Fast forward 1 week and a half and still no arrival of any package from Gap . I logged back in to check what had occurred and yet again my order got updated to a new date I’ve been patient this whole time gave it one more week . This day came where I decided to call customer support was a bit complex pressing 1 2 or 3 finding out how to reach a representative I finally was able to talk to one we spoke and the result was this man wanted me to return the item and he would help aid and repurchase the item for me hmmm here I thought for a quick second at the logic the representative had to fix the issue he said we will return the item and repurchase it ……………… I was took out by this response in my head here I was thinking why would I want to repurchase an item that’s already purchased and supposedly shipping out this would put me back in the exact same spot I’m in at this very moment. Extending my shipping and going through the whole buy again process I told the dude what I thought to him it seemed fine .I’ve wore Gap since I was a child a toddler so I still have a bit of calmness but any purchasing online I would highly recommend not to do unless you feel lonely and you want to talk to a representative about how unprofessional this whole process has been thank you to anyone who reads this review to end it I won’t be purchasing any gap anytime soon especially not online .\n",

No need. Never again! Will never order to them or go to the store!( my patience is gone!!!!) CUSTOMER SERVICE IS about helping the customer, figure out things, give them options, cooperate and talk to them, build a friendly connection. Working as a customer service agent is pretty hard. I know you guys stress. But if you guys work in the Customer Service industry. We have no choice(you accept that job),( when you guys are stress answering the phone it reflects that you are not happy with your job)We still need to smile and move on. The next time you answer the phone. Smile even the Customer/Guest can’t see you. It’s still reflects on our voice. Tell to your supervisor or manager your stress and move on. Don’t give it to your Guest. We get discouraged to order again. (Okay, going to different online store)POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! Never anymore.\n",

      "Review: I won’t ever buy from babyGap again or the gap stores or any of their subsidiaries. Their customer service is horrible,they route you to a South American country ( as the rep who answered told me) which would be fine if we could communicate but the only language I speak is English so I am unable to communicate with their customer service reps. The person could not understand anything that I was saying, my order was being shipped to the wrong address and after 10 frustrating minutes that he repeated something that he made up in his head because he couldn’t understand my English, we accomplished nothing. When I kept reading the confirmation number of my order with the letter G for Girl and repeated that many times he kept saying D for dog that was just five minutes of frustration there let alone each and every word that I said he could not understand it and would repeat something completely different . When I told him my order is going to the wrong address and I just placed the order today and I needed it to go to the correct address he repeated so you want to know what date your order is arriving ?He told me that I’m calling a South American country for customer service and then eventually hung up. Although he was polite and with every sentence I said ,he said thank you for that information and repeated thank you for that information many times, with whatever information I gave him he repeated a different sentence .When I placed this order it inadvertently is being sent to me as opposed to the gift recipient and I placed this order today. I repeated numerous times that I placed this order online today as one order he kept repeating I went to a store and I placed one order there and the other order online. I have no idea what he’s even talking about . I could not resolve having this order going to the proper address so now I need to get the order &wrap it and re-ship it to the gift recipient. The whole point of me ordering baby items from baby gap was in order to have it shipped directly to the recipient. Their customer service is horrible and to no fault of the person who does not understand English but unless I spoke another language I definitely could not resolve this problem. Obviously the Gap has their customer service overseas to save money but having properly trained customer service reps who could understand the caller should be of utmost importance.\n",

She immediately understood the problem and proceeded to repurchase and ship the shirts at an even better discount than I had before while processing the return for the bungled shipment. Honestly, this was probably the most competent and enjoyable customer service experience I've ever had with a business, especially when the issue wasn't even GAP's fault.

They said, let's wait until the end of October to see if the bra is returned in the mail. Meanwhile, I have no bra and no money. The least Gap could do is recognize that we are in usual circumstances (and that the post office is in collapse right now), take customers' word about returns, and return our money. It is not acceptable to wait two months for my money back. Furthermore, each time I call Gap to try to solve the issue by phone, I am put on hold and the entire phone call sometimes lasts over half an hour. The people on the phone are friendly, but that doesn't solve any of the above issues.\n",

They gave me rewards on my Gap credit card ($125 worth) and every time I try to purchase clothing using these rewards, they send me an email a week later telling me that what I ordered is no longer in stock, then it takes up to two billing cycles for the rewards to be reapplied to my account.  They are basically trying to prevent me from actually using the rewards they gave me towards clothing purchases.  Too much to be a coincidence.

We went to a Gap store, and got the 3 xs bras, trying them on, and seeing the the xs were the right size and the small were to big, so we wanted to cancel the 3 small that we ordered. Then, we spent over an hour on hold, and trying to get connected to a chat to try and cancel the order. We even sent emails. We never did get connected. We figured we'd refuse the package when it came, but it was delivered to the wrong address, and the only address on the package was the road name. Nothing else.

I went to try the chat feature today (July 31, 2020) since I have a sore throat and didn't want to make a phone call. I was emailing senseless until Shikyesha today sorted out the mess and gave me the refund I spent weeks requesting. If customer service is failing you right now, I advise giving the chat feature a try. It's much more convenient and saves more time than a phone call and it gets the job done. Thanks again for the quality customer service, Shikyesha!\n",

      "Review: This is the worst customer service and clothing store I have ever had. First, I ordered $ 300 worth of clothes and 75% of them were canceled due to a backorder which was not showing on their website when I ordered . No one also contacted me to let me know that almost my entire order was canceled. Adding to that the refund was wrong, I had to contact them to get the correct amount for the refund.Also, my order took 2 MONTHS to get here. After 5 emails I sent them asking for a prepaid shipping label because the website wouldn't allow me to print one for some unknown reason, I got an automatic email saying they don't could not help me with my request due to high call volume.So at the end of the day 75% of my order was canceled and what I received that didn't match correctly I'm not getting a refund because they are too busy.This is by far the worst customer service ever. I understand we are in a Covid-19 situation, but a big company like this shouldn't offer customer service like this, especially when on the news they said they made a money tone when Covid-19.WILL.NEVER.BUY.GAP.ANYMORE\n",

My order has said it was shipped but I haven't received any updates for 3 weeks and the tracking does not work. I've tried calling three separate times and you will just be on hold for the whole time you wait. I've emailed them and they email me back saying they will not be replying due to volume of emails. This is ridiculous. I have never seen a company struggle more than this one. This is so bizarre that I almost feel like I'm dealing with a scam artist. Will I ever receive my order? At this point, I think that won't happen. If someone could get a hold of me I will gladly change my review and mind but for the mean time, do not waste your money on this company. They will gladly take your money, not send you your order, and then won't let you be able to contact them. Go to a company like American Eagle, that has Covid restrictions but still gets their orders out in a timely manner.\n",

      "Review: Worst service ever . First time a year ago, I ordered, they lost the parcel, customer service are huge liars , they would never tell the truth only keep lying to you so you’d shut up and wait for your shipment with no use. Then I make the mistake of ordering again this year and I have a similar problem . No email to confirm delivery or tracking number nothing then I called the customer service and she sends me an unofficial email , basically her typing it and then I wait nothing literary nothing after three weeks they inform me there is no parcel with my tracking number then I cancel and wait for the long process of getting my money . Call and call again only to be humiliated by the complaining department . Now after 3 weeks they tell me contact the bank you’re not our problem . How rude and irresponsible.  They should close down the app and fire everyone . Don’t buy waste of money and time . Buy  from the store where you can actually get the merchandise and get refunded when you need it .\n",

      "Review: Seems like people have terrible experience. Let's see when my latest order arrives. Personally, I never had any shipping problems until now. I paid for 2 day shipping and it's been almost 2 weeks! Unacceptable! But I guess it's not their fault, it's the courier company's fault.I love their selvedge line (the 100% cotton ones), I just hope they offer more cuts, colors, and even heavier weights on their denim. The rest of their selection are meh, you can get much better and even cheaper basics on other brands. Personally, I think gap should just focus on making casual workwear inspired clothes. Maybe some 5 pocket/chino style duck canvas pants, field jackets, anything selvedge, there is a gap in that area bec no company as large as GAP (as far as I know) offers those. Actual workwear brands have cuts for actual work and it just looks bad wearing casually so I doubt Gap will compete with them for some time.I would love to have access to 100% cotton heavyweight duck canvas apparel, heavy selvedge denim and everything heavy without having to resort ordering from abroad or online on small stores.\n",

When the order didn’t arrive I contacted Gap, who told me the system showed it had been delivered to the store. I contacted the store who informed me that the order was still on its way. After contacting Gap a few more times, I was finally told that there had been a problem, and my order would not be delivered. After expressing my dissatisfaction, I was offered a discount code, however although I  chased this, the code never arrived. Such disappointing service from a store I previously really liked. I don’t plan on shopping here again.\n",

      "Review: I have been a Silver Gap card member for over 20 years. I will never, ever shop with them again. This is the 21st century yet you are not able to change the ship to address if it accidentally shipped to the address you last used. A mere seconds after I placed the online order, I realized it was shipping to my sister's apt. I called customer service immediately but they told me they could not change the address!! I said are you kidding? this is beyond ridiculous. They said they could only cancel the order and then I would have to reorder everything. I said absolutely not. Then they had the audacity to tell me that one item could not be canceled; remember, this is a mere minute after I clicked place order. So now, one of my christmas gifts is shipping to my sister's apartment. I told them I would never shop with again and that I would cancel my credit card. They thought that sending me a 20% off coupon would mitigate the damages. What company in this day and age is unable to alter a shipping address from their end a mere minute after the order was placed????\n",

      "Review: I can see that over 70% of the reviews are bad on Truspilot. This is not surprising as Gap have no respect for there loyal customers either. I have been buying Gap cloths for over 25 years now and recently bought three pairs of Pyjamas worth £44. Unfortunately due to defective materials the garments  have shrunk despite following correct washing instructions. When I wrote an email to there CEO Mr. Peck firstly he does NOT believe in replying to customers directly, as he feels customers are not that important. This is a guy who is paid millions of dollars in salaries and bonus yet takes customers for granted. Eventually I got a reply from a disrespectful member of team who was only blowing Gaps trumpet in how good they are and asked me to take the clothes to a Gap store. Even though I had bought the garments online and supplied pictures which don’t lie I was basically told to get lost in the usual Gap language. I use to spend over £1000 per annum but for sake of £44 these amateurish organisations behaved in an abhorrent way despite supplying proof with pictures. I would never buy from these cowboys again. Beware as they DO NOT appreciate loyalty and should you experience any faults with your garments they will tell you to go for a ride. Avoid buying from them is the only way to hurt these cowboys in taking customers for a ride in this abhorrent way.\n",

I must have rung gap up to 8 tones over the period of a month to get this sorted. In the meantime I was given a discount an had to reorder again even though I’d had no refund for the first order. I thought it was a joke when my second order arrived again in the wrong size. So I sent it back and for some reason it was refunded in a week. I had to then reorder another colour just to get a hoody in the right size but eventually after much messing around fone calls to customer services an trips to the post office to return I was happy I’d finally got the hoody in the right size. I spent the next two weeks chasing the refund for my first order I told customer services I was not happy with all the messing about and I think they should compensate me, she said she would email me some vouchers but she never did. She said she was launching an inquiry in to the warehouse to locate my return an this may take a few days. After 2 days they email me saying they are refunding me but not at the price I paid but the discount price is been given on my second order!! For gods sake I’ve never know such incompetence ever, first time I’ve ordered on line an never again in fact never shopping at gap again. I call customers services to sort it all out again and went though having to explain the whole issue I’d been going through the advisor was rude and hung up on me so I had to call back again and again explain to another advisor called Debbie who within seconds clearly didn’t want to hear me moving about my longwinded story and refunded me for the first order at the price I paid. She couldn’t get me off the phone quick enough! Always speak to an American call centre and out of the 8 times I had to call all the advisors were trying to help me but two were rude patronising and the tone on their voice smarmy and sarcastic made me really annoyed. At last all of this hassle and I’ve been told I will get my refund but how long that will take I don’t know. I wish I’d have seen all these reviews before attempting to buy a jumper on line. Awful experience and I will never shop in gap online or in store again. A company this big really needs to get their act together. Stay away at all costs!

The socks all had holes in after one wear. The waistbands on all the hoodies have loosened after one wear and turned into baggy dresses. The jeans have all worn out and split at the crotch after only 2 washes.

You can see they have great team spirit, i had a lady and a man helping me and another lady also offered to help her colleagues. Wish I had got their names. They are an asset to the company. Would definitely recommend visiting the Wimbledon store if you are after a great shopping experience with lovely staff.\n",

I wasted 40 minutes in their store today while they tried to look up my card, only to be told I’ll have to call customer service on my own time to - probably never - resolve my issue. My advice is DO NOT get a GAP credit card, unless you’re a fan of headaches. I completely regret getting the credit card, and I’m not going to even bother shopping there again to redeem my rewards after my waste of time today. University Village Gap store in Seattle had awful customer service. The manager was barely willing to lift a finger to help. And was annoyed that she had to reexplain their ridiculous policy. No apologizes, no real sympathy, no offering how to make it easier in any way. Repeat: DO NOT GET A CREDIT CARD. And save yourself from the staff at U village GAP, and shop... anywhere else.\n",

I ordered them on a Thursday thinking that the order would be processed on Friday and delivered on Saturday, the day before Father's day.  Well not so.  Gap doesn't tell you an expected ship date until a couple days later and now I find out that the order won't make it in time for Father's Day.  I called them and told them it never said the delivery date would be so much later than 1 day, they said I should have found their delivery policy online.  I asked them to refund the expedited delivery and they said they would not do that.  So you are going to hide the expected delivery date from your customer, and then won't refund the cost of the expedited shipping once it was clear that there wasn't any notification during ordering.  This is bs.  Gap also didn't inform me that this purchase would be a Mail Only return until after I was sent the confirmation email for the order.  If I had known that you can't return the item in the store, I would have shopped somewhere else.  I am NEVER using gap online ever again.  Borderline criminal.\n",

That is it. No, they cannot help me with that.2. Having lost the receipt, my return was not accepted. Although, online info says \"\"Without proof of purchase and order date, you can return items for a merchandise exchange or a merchandise certificate only based on the selling price on the date of return.” No. That is not possible. Just not possible. They don't do that sort of thing. That online information probably means something else.Emailing does not get you anywhere. They do not respond.

Customer service recently couldn’t give me an answer as to why Hermes said a package of mine was delivered and signed for by me. I was at home all day and a delivery attempt was not made. Instead of looking into this with Hermes I was told by Gap to wait to align with their internal timings for raising delivery disputes. While they have my money for a package that is either lost or stolen. Similar has happened to my parents with a Gap packaged delivered by Hermes - left in a safe space a week ago but no package in sight. Gap have not done anything.

The woman on the phone explained to me that the jacket was never shipped from them it was supposed to be shipped from a store and the store must not have had the jacket in stock so they were unable to fulfill the order. So the store who had no jacket to ship left it at that our card was charged we did not receive product left it at that if I would not have called I wonder what would have happened. No emails no apologies and now almost 3 weeks later my son has no winter jacket mind you we live in Minnesota mind you that not a Gap store around us even sells winter jackets in the store there's a problem right there hello it is Minnesota why can we not carry jackets in the store why do I need to order them online. Anyways after I cancelled the order this morning to get my refund because apparently there was no jacket ever but nobody was ever going to tell me that. I was sent an email telling me that my item has been returned we returned our item and we will be refunded no we did not return anything we never received it and we were charged for it a lot of other places don't charge you until the item is shipped like there's a huge problem here that needs to be resolved and the only thing that was done about it it was covered up and hidden from maybe somebody who could fix the. By saying that we return the item looks like we didn't like it that never happened we never received an item. And now it's going to take up to 10 days for us to get our money back for something we never even had in my book that's stealing they stole our money if we did that to them they would have put us in jail thank you gap for all your wonderful years of wonderful beautiful comfortable clothing but my relationship with you has came to an end.\n",

They were never helpful and kept just sending macros and pre-written 'apologies' about the delay. They promised me overnight shipping and even swore that it would be shipped from the UK to Ireland at 10pm on the 7th of December for arrival on the next morning. Obviously it didn't turn up. Following that I got an email saying they're backlogged and it could take 30 days (!?) to ship, maximum. I ordered two things. I've bought cheap tat from China without tracking that's arrived faster.So on the 10th, I get an email saying it's shipped. Phew. That's a relief. But no, no it isn't. The tracking still hasn't updated as of the 12th - so I chat them again. The girl straight up offers me a refund. I didn't even ask - which makes me think something was up. I did ask, 'So I'm not getting my order - given it was mean to be overnighted?' and she said it looks unlikely. So now I have a charge on my account waiting to be reversed for an order I placed 3 weeks ago - that was never sent. Just awful all around.

Here is where things become ugly ,when I did not receive the items on that dateI checked in to see the order status and was changed to be delivered on December 05 ,2017(Still okay with this:)). I started following on the status knowing that they might change it again and when I checked again on the  4th of December 2017,they again updated the delivery date to the 09th of December and now I called to customer service knowing that they might do something about it.The person(male forgot his name?) I talked to was nice and willing to help me with that. First he said sorry for that and took off the shipping and handling fee and guaranteed it will be delivered on the 06th of December. I followed up and saw the status is still on the 09th of December and I thought he might forgot to update me. I called again on the 05th of December to talk to another agent (her name may be Amanda? sorry for that)She said that I need to call to the carrier(Which I thought is none of my business) to hold the item in their facility until I return back( what?)I told her I need the item as a gift to the persons I'm traveling to. She keep on holding me a lot of times as if she's figuring out something(Which I don’t think much is going on while I was in hold...probably I was in hold for 20minutes) anyways, She comes backand told me she is taking off 30% of the price I was charged, Still told her I don’t need the price adjustments and needed to talk to the supervisor. She told me thatthe supervisor will do nothing at all and I told her I will at least try my chances to pass my concerns. After the usual long hold, I 'm able totalk to the supervisor(which do nothing as the agent suggested, at least the agent got this right:)) to my surprise to inform me that the order is cancelled and the amount will be credited(What?) Did I tell you  to cancel my order? the Supervisor is horrible and I don’t think she should be there. I told her why they are losing customers toAmazon and other big players and told her I will never be GAP's /Banana Republic's customer anymore(thank you for taking my money for more than a decade) and will write my experience onthe review to their site and any social networking sites I use.

      "Review: Unfortunately I will be not be shopping with GAP again. I bough jeans online, and had issues returning 3 items. I tried to get in touch by phone and by email. Response to emails was very slow - it was 5 days before I had any kind of response (which was automated and asked for information I had already provided). I replied immediately and received a response a week later. In the meantime, I finally got through to Customer Service by phone, after calling several times - most times  I could not get through and was left on hold until I gave up and hung up (at least 15 minutes). When I did get through I was told that my refund should have been processed, and would be done within 72 hours - I have received another email since saying this could take up to a week. I'm curious to see if it will actually turn up..!I cannot understand how such a large and established company has such poor customer service, and I will not be shopping with GAP again. Having to work for a refund seems ridiculous to me, and I have spent several hours in total trying to get in contact.\n",

They have been completely unresponsive and seem to be in no way interested in making this right.  Absolutely terrible customer service experience.

I was out of town for wedding and unfortunately there was no service at all, so I missed few of my usual payments and as I came back I paid some of them right the way but as I had some extra expenses on my brothers wedding I left the Gap bill to be paid on the next due date as I was already late and late payment fee was already applied so it makes more sense for me to just make my next payment on the next due date. But wait! they are calling me from 15 to 27 times a day literally starting at 7am and up until 11pm constant calling Even though I had spoken to a costumer service right after I came back and explained what happend and what is my plan they said It is absolutely understandable and that they will be expecting next payment when it is due. But the calling never stopped I had to block one of their numbers because it feels absolutely wrong to receive this many calls after you spoke to someone about it but now they call from Russia . This is just absurd I only missed one payment First time since I had this card. I am going to close this account when I pay it off and will never have another card with them again .

      "Review: I had a terrible experience purchasing jeans online around the holidays.  Got numerous emails stating the order was delayed which would be followed by emails asking me how I liked my new jeans which had not yet arrived.  Finally after three weeks and many hours wasted on hold the agent suggested cancelling the order and buying them in the store which I did.  However, the now unwanted supposedly cancelled jeans showed up the next day!  Another call to online customer service and more time on hold, and as a courtesy I was told I could keep the jeans and they would credit me back the price.  Unfortunately we no longer needed the jeans because I had bought another set and they were the wrong size anyway. The agent on the phone at the time said just take them back to the store and exchange them for something else. But the store won't honor the exchange because it was a dispute with gap.com, and gap.com won't honor the exchange because they have terrible customer service.  It doesn't help me to have free jeans that don't fit, so the courtesy they extended to acknowledge the hassle they put me through is meaningless.  I will never use gap online again when the customer service at the store is so much better.\n",

I then received another letter today. THREE WEEKS AFTER they said it was taken care of saying that my credit card was approved. I then had to call @gap again where I was hung up on and transferred SEVERAL times to finally speak to someone that could help me. She was unbelievably rude and unhelpful. She said that my application was redacted and when I asked for my name and details to be removed from the system she proceeded to create an inquiry into this, and said I would receive a letter in twenty days. When I asked why it would take twenty days to just delete my basic information from the system and what the letter would say she was unable to give me any further information. And then threatened me that she would not send my inquiry in. Needless to say I am extremely annoyed, aggravated, and among other things will not be supporting @gap at any of their stores or sister stores. It is a complete outrage to be treated like this when this is @gap mistake. I posted this on Gap's Facebook page and they responded almost a day later that they do not deal with the card accounts and I need to speak to Synergy Bank that is in charge of this.

      "Review: If you can, avoid shopping with Gap online from Austalia. Western Australia doesn't have a Gap store so my only option was ordering goods from the US (even after phoning the Melbourne store but they wouldn't post). The shipping of two pairs of girls shorts cost $42, almost as much as the shorts alone were worth. After a week, I inquired about the shipping advice (given I hadn't received a dispatch confirmation) only to be told that the goods had already been delivered. The problem was that I was in Australia and the goods had been delivered to somewhere in Illinois, US. After corresponding with Gap and asking them to resend the goods but expedite the shipping, given I had lost a week from the original timeline, I was advised post-shipment that the original timeline of the order had been extended and that they may take between 2.5 to 5 weeks to arrive, not counting the week lost from the incorrect delivery. The original advice communicated from Gap in the sales transaction was 2-4 weeks. Gap customer service was at best ambivalent, seemingly wanting to shift responsibility to Borderfree. When paying A$42 for shipping for a package of probably less than 1kg, I expect better service, as I can imagine, would others. Additionally, after further correspondence with Gap's customer service, they stated that if I was unhappy with their online ordering that I could set up a US address and ship there. It's quite stunning really that a company like Gap would offer this as an alternative rather than improving global business and addressing deficiencies in their point to point shipping. Put simply, avoid shopping online at Gap from Australia until they actually start to listen to customers. Until then, they are only paying lip service about customer service and overcharging overseas customers with exorbitant shipping rates.\n",

I meant with Manager David and Customer Rep Darren, who after a completed transaction so they called it could not give me a confirmed receipt they placed online stating the email would come, even until today Feb 9, 2016 I have not received the so called transaction. They were giving flimsy excuses about wifi this or that... Later come to find out my order was messed up as of today and the prices as they showed me in the store was not the prices the online associates put. As an evidence, My credit card when I called them had a recorded voice of myself and the rep telling the amount of price to approve for the transaction.  My point here is please BEWARE of gap store both online and in store, they are not what they say they are...

      "Review: My mom had 100 dollars Gap Cash from when she shopped in NY with my sister. In Colorado, we decided to each spend 100 in Gap, she paid for everything and I paid her back. Before going in, I looked at some Gap \"featured\" outfits and really liked the plaid Henley shirt paired with the flair out pants. We got to the store, but only one plaid Henley shirt was there in XL, not my size. However, I did find the flair out pants. My mom had liked a silk shirt I showed her online, but it also wasn't in store because it was a new style. My mistake, to look online and expect to find it in store. So, we bought the things we could in store, and the cashier ordered the silk shirt and plaid henley, both in medium, through Gap.com. Three weeks later, the package arrives (it took a while), inside was the silk shirt, but instead of the Henley shirt, there is a pair of leggings with a label on it saying it is the plaid Henley. I research online to see which store in Colorado might have the plaid Henley in the right color and size medium. Unfortunately, shirt is sold out online in s, m, and l. The only store that has the right shirt style is in Aurora, 45 minutes away from my house. I put on hold the Medium and Large, the medium was in the wrong color but i was trying it for size, my last resort if the large didn't work being to have my sister in NY get it, which would be complicated because it's an exchange and not just a purchase. Finally, i get to Gap in Aurora and decide the Large is ok. But, because the plastic was labeled as plaid henley and had leggings in it, they said I could not just give them the leggings in exchange for the shirt. The whole process took at least 30 minutes, mostly the employee was getting instructions from a lady on the phone. My review is not against the Gap employees at this store, but rather the lady who was on the phone and Gap.com. Anyways, I didn't just walk out with the plaid Henley (already paid for mind you), I had to pay for the shirt and then now have to ship the leggings to Gap and wait 7 days to be refunded for the shirt. It was so complicated and I have to to all this extra work now. Hopefully I will even be refunded correctly because the receipt from paying today said the tax was 8%, whereas the invoice from online (what was paid before) says 4.25%. What I paid for the plaid Henley was also 50 cents more than the original purchase. So basically, I may be out just a couple dollars, which is ok, but annoying, gas, and time spent. Not much, but it's a lot when it wasn't my mistake and they still make me pay for THEIR mistake. I don't even want this shirt that bad anymore, it didn't fit that nicely because my boobs are too big for it and so the large fit better for that reason, but is wider than would be most flattering. Whatever, I'm ok with that though. Nevertheless, I'm never shopping at Gap or any affiliate stores again because this experience was so annoying and I think their clothes are boring (At Gap).I honestly don't want anything from Gap, like restitution, but they just better refund me correctly. Originally I paid 35.80 for the shirt (cheaper since we used gap cash) but today I paid 37.75 because the shirt cost more and the tax was double. So which will they refund me? The ladies at the store said they'll refund the invoice which is less than what I paid today. Why am I paying for your mistake??\n",

      "Review: I received a pair of jeans through the post which had been obviously poorly manufactured due to the fact that the fit in each leg was completely different: tight in one leg and loose in the other. As a result I called Gap Customer Service and they told me they couldn't exchange items but could refund them and get me the same pair of jeans at the same discounted price that I got them in before, which seemed like a rather arduous and unnecessary process. However, the assistant out in a new order to the same delivery location that I previously had them delivered to, without heeding me or asking any questions. I wanted to get the jeans sent to a work address because unfortunately I do not always have the luxury of being at home. Even after explaining this I was simply told that the order couldn't be cancelled definitively and the assistant would have to put in a cancellation request that doesn't always go through, which would have ended up in me getting 2 pairs of the same jeans. I guess I will have to hope the neighbours are in or else I will have to spend one of my Saturdays travelling off to a collection depot miles outside of London. What joy!\n",

      "Review: I have never in my life had a problem with jeans wearing out. That's why I bought from GAP. Yes, their product was moderately expensive, but they fit me fantastically and moreover they LASTED. I would get new jeans more because of growing out of them or significant style changes, but usually I'd wear them for two or three years with no problem whatsoever. In recent years though prices have climbed. What's more, to add insult to injury the quality has plummeted. The company where I used to get jeans for $45 and keep them for three years now charges me $70 for jeans that rip or wear through in a little more than a year. (I am no more active while wearing my jeans than I used to be, if anything I am less so!) Stubbornly I use iron-on patches and rotate the poorer quality pairs into less public/frequent use. Today though is perhaps the final straw. A pair roughly one year old suddenly has a sizable hole on the inner thigh. I feel so betrayed. For over 10 years I give brand loyalty to GAP and this is how I am repaid? By considerably more expensive but far poorer quality products than when I first began shopping with them? If only because I have an unused gift card I will give them one final chance. But after that I plan to find a new brand.\n",

      "Review: I tried to return a birthday present I'd bought online about an hour after I bought it, as I realized I'd failed to take advantage of an offer.  They refused to cancel it, said they could not do it, they could only put in a \"request\" to cancel.  Not only that, but they HAVE NO IDEA when they can tell if if it's canceled or not.   Bull.  They can process an order within minutes, but they can't cancel it within minutes, and in fact \"have no idea\" if it will be DAYS before they can tell you it's canceled?  And get this:  I wanted to cancel so I could go online and make a LARGER purchase!  Now I can't buy a LARGER birthday present for this person because I don't know if the first one was canceled or not!!!  When they say they \"can't,\" they mean \"won't.\"  They need some serious customer-friendly competition to make them realize what they can or can't do.  I would NEVER use them again.\n",

      "Review: I purchased some jeans for my daughters for Christmas. AFTER the purchase was completed, there was a note about their \"new\" return policy.  Seems that returns/exchanges can only be done for 45 days.  Christmas is 60 days away.  Multilple emails to customer \"service\" were fruitless--as another reviewer said, \"arrogant and smarmy\" would about cover it.  So I returned the merchandise forthwith. Gap must be doing very well if they're  OK with losing a sale and alienating not one but potentially 3 customers.\n",
