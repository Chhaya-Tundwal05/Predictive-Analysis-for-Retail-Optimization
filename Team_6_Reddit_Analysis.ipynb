Some just wouldn't leave the store.  Eventually it was found out that an underground DJ had said that the aliens were coming in the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet, and the place to go meet them and be saved was our location. People brought in their children. The next day was the comet and Heaven's Gate Suicide made the news.\n",

However, when she was trying to give me the store credit it said my return was denied but that she was able to override it and that i just wouldn‚Äôt be able to return in the future. is this common? i work retail myself and i‚Äôve literally never heard of this before, and i‚Äôve never returned anything late  or without a receipt to old navy or any of their brands before.\n",

      "Description: I was about 25 days out from my delivery date and the self-service return function was no longer available and it had a link to their Return FAQ.  It seemed clear I was in the 30 day return from delivery date policy.  So I called and the rep said that they stop accepting returns a \"few\" days before the 30 day limit because it takes time for the item to arrive to them.  The return policy says the item must be \"return\", which to me means using the self-service function to create an RMA and label, and then X amount of days to get it in the mail.  I made clear to the rep that their language is incorrect if that's what the policy is, and that if they don't accept the return I will never shop at Gap (long time shopper here).  She capitulated and created the return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seems clear to me that this approach is intentionally designed to trim the return window with the hope that when customers seek to return, they see the message that it cannot be return and be passive about it.  The policy is from the delivery date rather than the order, so I bet some customers calculate 30 days from the order date and when return is prevented give up.  The scenario that a customer will phone and call them out on the policy is baked into the approach, and they'll just allow the return.\n",

Thinking I just got some bad ones, I reordered the black and grey ones and pants with the exact same issues.

      "Description: It seems like every brand I look into has supposedly had huge decreases in quality in the last few years. Raybans, Brooks Brothers, Ralph Lauren, Massimo Dutti, etc. There's mall brands, which are always popular because they have a name, but they rarely have actually good clothing. H&M, Zara, Gap, Old Navy, American Eagle, Banana Republic, all the brands you see at malls occasionally have decent items for reasonable prices but they're all varying degrees of bad to mediocre quality and many of them are uncomfortable to wear. And then for the designer, almost all of them are way outside my price range. I can see paying 100-150 for a pair of pants if they're going to last me years, but I'm not buying Balenciaga pants for 2 grand because they say Balenciaga. Is there really no middle range anymore where you spend a decent amount of money but get good to great quality in return?\n",
      "\n",
      "The only brands I've heard some recommendations for are Uniqlo, Abercrombie and Fitch, and J Crew, but even then opinions seem lukewarm at best. I'll find some people who say they love their clothes from Uniqlo, others say quality has gone down a lot in the past few years and its no longer worth the money. Same for the other brands I just listed. The only brand that seems to have a truly good reputation is Patagonia, but unfortunately I'm just not looking for that style of clothing right now. So where am I supposed to buy some nice chinos, linen shirts, knitwear, and t-shirts?\n",

      "Bought these beige Old School 90's High Rise jeans a couple days as they were on sale. Was thinking wow finally some affordable high waisted, not slim casual jeans in a decent colour that _actually_ fit. I should have known better. Put them on for about 2 hours as I went out to get a coffee and test them out, then afterwards through them in the wash. I did everything the label told me to do, followed the symbols to a T, and yet I was rewarded with disaster. The fabric around the back pocket corners just disintegrated in the wash, I've never seen anything like it. The cuffs also got a little beat up too for some reason. All the damage was around areas of multiple laters of fabric and heavy stitching. I'd be pissed if this happened after 1 year of wear let alone 1 laundry cycle. Is this just the state of BR now or is this an outlier? Luckily I still have the tag so imma try and return in the following days. I'm just so sad cuz I was really looking forward to these pants, oh well.\n",

The sale is never the ENTIRE store, but it is a good portion and the \"40% off\" sign is always on the front door/online front page. What does it say about a brand to ALWAYS have such an extensive discount on their products? That they're overpriced without the sale? That they have a crap ton of different product lines that they're always introducing and getting rid of? That their sale prices are just their regular prices and the sale is just to get people in the door? \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It‚Äôs important to understand that this guide is evolutionary, not revolutionary ‚Äì there are basic principles to follow that will hold fast even as styles change, and many are in past guides. This is also not a shopping list, as listing items you must buy defeats the purpose of this exercise of reworking your wardrobe ‚Äìyou should look to find your own personal interests in style, and build upon them. You will never feel comfortable wearing clothes that don‚Äôt appeal to you. Thus, this guide is aimed at taking you through the basic principles, giving you some recommendations on what to look at (and what not to look at), and some potential ideas for you to consider. Naturally this will lean towards the casual side of things given the readership of MFA, but I have included a short business section as there are often questions regarding proms or interviews.\n",

      "----\n",
      "#Principles\n",
      "----\n",
      "Before you think about purchasing anything, there are a few concepts that you have to first understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fit**\n",
      "\n",
      "The number 1 most important thing is how the clothes fit on you. Ill-fitting items will always look bad, regardless of how interesting or good-looking the garment is. Take your time to understand good fit, and you‚Äôre half way there. There are a number of principles you can follow ‚Äì simple things like having the shoulder seam of clothing hitting the end of your shoulder, and having items that follow the form of your body, rather than be too restrictive or baggy. There is a sweet spot you will find. Finding an item you really like the fit of and taking its measurements will certainly be a useful tool. **I urge you to take a look at the most up-to-date fit guide in the sidebar for a deeper look into this.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there are many situations where clothing with a slouchy fit works. But here you are learning to walk before you run, so it is important to really nail good fit before bending the rules to suit your personal style ‚Äì something you should build and experiment with once you have the basics down.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Simplicity**\n",
      "\n",
      "Something beginners struggle with relates to over-complicating what they are wearing. By this, I mean matching patterns and colours incorrectly, which can make any outfit jarring regardless of the fit, or buying busy items that are difficult to work with. Often, the simplest items combine together to make the best outfits.\n",
      "\n",
      "When starting out, you want to play on the idea of subtlety. Think of a slightly subdued colour palette, as these colours lend themselves towards versatility. You can pair navy, earthy greens and solid tans much more easily than you can stark reds and bright blues and yellows. That‚Äôs not to say bright colours can‚Äôt work, but again, it is worth really understanding colour-matching before utilising statement pieces. Similarly, using dark colours in a range of colour tones ‚Äì black-grey-white being a classic example ‚Äì are also easy to pull together into an outfit, whilst maintaining this idea of contrast that you want to create.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a general rule of thumb for beginners, it is useful to create a nice contrast between top and bottom. Darker trousers with a lighter shirt allows for a simple contrast that works well. This is a principle you can also look to for layering ‚Äì slightly different tones of colour for tee and jacket make for a nice combination. Similar contrasts can be created with different textures as well ‚Äì smooth cotton denim with a wool jacket for example, is a classic way of creating a subtle contrast even if the colours aren‚Äôt very different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once understood, you can look into other colour palettes ‚Äì greyscale monochrome looks are quite popular without being overly taxing to create. Beyond this you can begin to mix in patterns, textures and starker colour contrasts (or no colour contrast at all) as you begin to understand how to pair such things. Then you can move on to developing your own personal style. /u/HugAndWug has created [a useful write-up on the topic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/34ayuf/developing_personal_style_20/)\n",

      "#Building a wardrobe\n",
      "----\n",
      "As stated, this isn‚Äôt a shopping list but rather a way to give you some ideas on what to look for when building a basic yet versatile and wardrobe. One thing I urge you to do before plunging into this is to **take your time** ‚Äì mull over items, think how they will work with your other items, and when you‚Äôre convinced of their versatility in a number of different outfits, make the purchase. This cautious approach will save you a lot of money and frustration.\n",

      "**Warm**\n",
      "\n",
      "* When the the sun is out, you want a good selection of light options. Get some solid plain crewneck tees in white, grey and natural colours, as they are a staple for layering and general wear. If you can find some with slight [texture or visual interest](http://i.imgur.com/AV08Mx6.jpg), that‚Äôs also a bonus, but notice that it is still a simple item. Same for polo shirts ‚Äì simple, well-fitting polos can work very well under a light jacket, and with a range of bottoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Grab a [henley](http://i.imgur.com/icRjjz4.jpg) for something a little different to the standard tee. These are great items for layering, especially under light jackets. There‚Äôs a useful henley spreadsheet [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtGJjRyhl_A5dHMyY1RSYkJjcjNpNDFoNXl2RTN5dHc&usp=sharing#gid=0)\n",
      "\n",
      "* For shirts, you can‚Äôt go wrong with some casual [oxford cloth button down shirts (OCBDs)](http://i.imgur.com/IkueEfi.jpg). Neutral colours are perfect for pairing with anything from jeans to shorts. However, it‚Äôs worth looking at other options as well. Linen shirts offer a bit more [visual interest](http://i.imgur.com/qP3Te6X.jpg), and are particularly good in high temperatures. They give a more relaxed and casual feel. Another good option is [chambray](http://i.imgur.com/V9yLmed.jpg). If you want to move away from solid colour items and have a bit more fun in the summer months, I suggest subtly patterned shirts such as a [darker floral](http://imgur.com/B15k2Gl), [polkadots](http://i.imgur.com/YY3PmJh.jpg), or [thinly striped/seersucker](http://i.imgur.com/GuL82Ko.jpg) styles. These patterned items also work well as short sleeved shirts (though be aware that the fit of short-sleeve shirts needs to be spot on for it to work well). Notice that the patterns recommended are still subtle, and thus offer good versatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cool**\n",
      "\n",
      "* As it gets colder, it is easier to experiment with different textures. For shirts, try out [flannels](http://i.imgur.com/PebToTs.jpg) ‚Äì soft and warm, these are inherently casual. They do come in solid colours, though are mostly seen in plaid patterns. See what you like ‚Äì they work well in almost all casual contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "* If you want something a little warmer, look for an overshirt. These tend to be thicker and made of heavy flannel or wool. Whilst not a necessity, it offers an alternative to a thick sweatshirt or jacket.\n",
      "\n",
      "* For an extra layer, you simply can‚Äôt go wrong with a heather grey sweatshirt or zip-up hoody. Simple but extremely versatile, and will go with practically anything for when it‚Äôs blustery or a bit cooler in the evening. With sweatshirts, you can go with any colour you see fit really, as they are a simple, throw-it-on-and-go sort of item. Just keep in mind the principles of contrast when starting out.\n",
      "\n",
      "* For something more substantial, grab a thicker wool crew neck jumper. Also available in a variety of colours, I‚Äôd suggest earthier, natural tones that generally work well in cooler times (think olives, browns, naturals, greys). These offer some interesting visual texture as well as extra warmth, but don‚Äôt overpower a simple fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "#Jackets\n",
      "\n",
      "**Warm**\n",
      "\n",
      "* There are plenty of good warm-weather jacket options. One of the best looks which pops up a lot are bomber jackets. These offer a classic silhouette that can be chucked on top of most things. These look fantastic in black and work very well in [monochromatic outfits](http://i.imgur.com/PMpgwr6.jpg), but also look good in [other colours.](http://i.imgur.com/tiQ9SSP.jpg)\n",
      "\n",
      "* Similarly, a denim jacket is a solid choice. Now as a beginner, it can be easy to get this wrong ‚Äì when starting out, getting a trucker style jacket that fits well, but is a different tone to your bottom half (contrasting) is a [solid](http://i.imgur.com/OMAj1aj.jpg) [choice.](http://i.imgur.com/imh9vPE.jpg) It may also help to avoid jeans when wearing one to begin with.

      "\n",
      "**Cool**\n",
      "\n",
      "* You will need a cold-weather jacket. One of the best casual options is a parka, which is a slightly long, hooded rain jacket, often with insulation. It is an inherently casual option that will [go with everything.](http://i.imgur.com/sobjxn0.jpg) Again, earthy tones are you‚Äôre best choice for versatility. You can also grab thinner ones for the warmer months.\n",
      "\n",
      "* I think another great and versatile option is a [dark overcoat](http://i.imgur.com/E1eDn7N.jpg), which has the potential to [look great.](http://i.imgur.com/Y7TtBqE.jpg) This item works well for a beginner because it can be very easily dressed up and down, offers interesting visual texture, and will introduce you to a slightly different silhouette to which you might not be used to. It‚Äôs a chance to open up your horizons a bit. \n",
      "\n",
      "#Bottoms\n",
      "\n",
      "* With the bottom half, there are a few staples that you really do have to have, especially when starting out. First are jeans. You should look for a dark indigo pair with no distressing, as it looks clean. Focus on fit with these ‚Äì try on a bunch of different pairs until you get one that fits you just right. Your preference for fit is up to you. I have quite skinny calves but am more sizeable up top, so I prefer a slim tapered silhouette. The best thing to do is try a bunch of different Levi‚Äôs cuts and find the one you find most flattering. \n",
      "\n",
      "* After solid blue jeans, you might want to look into a black pair. They‚Äôll be virtually [just as versatile](http://i.imgur.com/fKyxs36.jpg), and can allow lighter items such as white shoes or shirts an opportunity to contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Chinos ‚Äì you‚Äôll never go wrong with a couple of pairs of chinos, which are flat-fronted, cotton twill trousers. My recommendation would be a navy and tan pair. These items will always come in handy casually, and are easy to dress up when the time comes. \n",
      "\n",

And then, olive, grey, khaki, burgundy, cream, wine... pastels, bright colors, whatever else you're thinking... Chinos lend themselves to all sorts of colors, whereas denim feels strange if it's anything other than blue or black.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compare 'em to wool dress pants. A dressy pair of chinos can be a proper pair of trousers, or at least pass as one in most contexts. Or a not-too-dressy pair could be a very subtle way to dress a blazer a half-step down. And then, after a few wears, you can just toss 'em into the wash.\n",

I wiped my tears and bought a new pair (that‚Äôs three pants purchases for those counting at home). \n",
      "\n",
      "Another few months went by, and I once again noticed a huge hole in my crotch. This seemed odd because the blue denim colored pants had no such problems. So I went back to the Banana Republic and purchased yet another pair. I had lost 27 pounds over the course of this time, and now found it was time to move into the size 34x34, and purchased those (purchase number four!) \n",

Another pair of the charcoal 34x34‚Äôs and away I went. \n",

My biggest issue when buying clothes is finding a good fit in the upper legs.\n",

      "- Brooks Brothers: I shopped in store but was disappointed to discover that they didn't have *any* Milano cut suits in stock. I was able to look at fabrics and tried on a Regent fit suit. The pants actually fit reasonably well and could have been tailored to a nice fit but the jacket hung like a sack. The sales person was quite knowledgeable but really tried to make the sale on a Regent whereas I went ahead with ordering Milano online (1x Milano Plaid 1818 and 1x Milano stretch-wool 2 button 1818)\n",
      "- J.Crew: They only had 1 slim-fit style/color in stock (Navy) but the sales person was great and assured me that the quality control was good and that any of the suits in the lineup will fit exactly the same. I ordered 3x Ludlow slim-fit, one in each color (light blue, charcoal, navy)\n",
      "- Banana Republic: Good selection in store but no sales help. It was all sold as separates and it was a bit difficult to find the right sizes. In the end I went home and ordered 1x slim italian wool and 1x houndstooth wool.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quality**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Brooks Brothers: To my untrained eye, the fabric and construction was a head and shoulders above the others. I was very impressed with the overall quality and couldn't find any faults.\n",
      "- J.Crew: The wool felt very nice and I checked everything over carefully for construction faults. Couldn't really find anything though. My one complaint was that the suit I liked the best (harbor blue) has an ugly white striped lining. Overall though I was very happy.\n",
      "- Banana Republic: Two very different results with the 2 suits. The houndstooth was terrible (navy, no longer on the website). The fabric looked worn and was kind of fuzzy and the lining was a butterfly style for warm weather. I probably didn't read the description well enough but it definitely looked a lot worse than the website pics. The italian wool one was much nicer though. It was obviously lower quality than the other ones but still looked great and actually fit the best of all pre-tailoring. I liked the peak lapels and the overall look of the suit a lot. One annoyance was that they sewed a cleaning instructions label into the lining seam where it is very visible. I tried to remove it but didn't want to damage anything so it will be a job for the tailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fit**\n",
      "\n",
      "- All of the jackets fit rather nicely with a little bit of tailoring needed for the arms length only.\n",
      "- For the pants though, the Milano cut was *far* to slim in the thighs. I think it would be more comparable to the extra-slim from the other lines. The waist too was a lot tighter despite being the same size. It wouldn't have been a problem to let out a little (salesperson said +1.5\" max) besides the cost and hassle of extra tailoring.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Price**\n",
      "\n",
      "- I was pretty happy with the prices I got from all three companies. I already had a Gap credit card for BR and I got ones for BB and JC as well for the extra discount. After Christmas is a good time to buy suits!\n",
      "- Brooks Brothers: Original price was 1x $1,198 and 1x 998 but sale was 2 for $1,190. After the new credit card discount, the total was $1,004 including 6.25% tax, so **$502** each. Not worth the full price though as the quality jump wasn't as big as the price jump.\n",
      "- J.Crew: Original price was $650 but I got a 1 day cardholders sale of -25% so **$496.50** each including tax. Great price but barely less than BB. Probably worth it at full price if you needed something quickly but otherwise a great deal at the sale price.\n",
      "- Banana Republic: Full price was $568 but I got a great deal here at **$300** each (no tax for some reason). I think additional sales can go as low as $250. At these prices they are well worth it but definitely not at full price. These suits are perfect budget options if you need to wear one everyday and can save the nicer suits for more important events (which is my plan).\n",

I'm also not going to be constantly thinking about lifting my shirt when walking out and about.  I also spent $100 on that belt which makes me sick now that I think about it.  It's a good belt though, but I feel it's way overpriced.\n",

I'm just worried that they will shrink with washing over time and become unwearable.\n",

      "The thing with me is that I really don't want to put too much thought into this.  I like blue jeans with washes similar to the picture and darker washes, and I know I can pretty much pair them with any type of shirt,  good enough for me.  I'm not a fashion model, I just wanted clothes that fit better.\n",

The black jeans are Levi 511 and it's weird because I tried on the same pair at a Sears today and the material wasn't as comfortable as the one I have, which is from the actual levi store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also weird that the black jeans and grey jeans are 32x30 Slims,  but the blue jeans are 31x32 and fit similarly.  The blue jeans are slim straights though.  Still not sure between the 30 length and 32.  Some jeans I tried, the 32 was too long, and others it seemed fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tomorrow I'm going to go back to the store and try the black and grey in 31 waist, and try them in 32 length too and experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Light blue polo is definitely too tight now that I tried it on again.  I also determined that the reason the solid navy polo fits better s because the material is stretchy, whereas the light blue is not.  I'll play around with going 1 size up though on both.   Polo with the blue pocket is going back.\n",

      "Description: It's interesting how, in your mind there are some brands that you'd never think you'd be able to afford. And then one day, you finally decide to go check them out, perhaps to splurge on a Grail piece, only to find out that they've pushed themselves down-market to compete with pedestrian brands. It's like saving up your whole life to buy a Ferrari, and then one day, you finally walk into the dealership, only to find that they sell Honda Civic competitors for $20,000 now. \n",
      "\n",
      "That pretty much sums up what I think of Gieves & Hawkes. At one point, they were thought of as the greatest brand in menswear, making suits that cost more than a months salary for royalty. After all, they are 1 Saville Row. But then, eventually, they (like every other classic menswear brand) dipped their tows into off the rack. \n",
      "\n",
      "But unlike say, Brioni or Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Gieves and Hawkes' off the rack lineup isn't just \"bespoke but made to a standard template\", it went down market. If their bespoke stuff is fantastic and worthy of royalty, their off the rack stuff is mass market and nothing really special. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the pieces of theirs that my brother has, Gieves and Hawkes RTW has mediocre construction, you know, \"it's fine\". Based on the construction, their suits and structured jackets are mediocre, the same stuff that you'll find at say, Hugo Boss or J Crew. \n",
      "\n",
      "But their real strength is the materials. They sell overcoats of pure alpaca, wool linen silk blends in their light sports jackets, some of their suits also use wool from top mills like Loro Piana. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gieves and Hawkes has a very traditional cut, but a very good looking one. They are after all, the most well known example of the Saville Row style, where the suit is trim, but not tight. Where the emphasized figure is big chest and broad shoulders, not the hourglass shape. It is a timeless cut, and IMO, it is far better than the Brooks Brothers sack (another commonly mentioned example of a timeless cut).\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the thing: Gieves & Hawkes has adopted the J Crew model of retail: most of their lineup is on sale at any given moment. On sale, their suits start at ~¬£300, and their jackets are start at ~¬£200. At these prices, they're shooting straight at the J Crew/Hugo Boss price tier. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gieves and Hawkes is sitting at J Crew tier prices. But I think their house cut is better than J Crew's \"skinny lapel, trim fit\" suits. They also are willing to use more interesting materials than J Crew. I guess they're also still more prestigious than J Crew or Banana Republic (but I have to say, their brand value is dropping fast)\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, Gieves and Hawkes RTW uses great materials for the most part, has a fantastic house cut, and construction that is in line with what you expect from their price range. I'm almost shocked they aren't a Uniqlo or J Crew tier meme brand here. I guess that's what happens when you don't have boutiques worldwide and aren't in every department store. \n",

      "\n",
      "Confused or uncertain? Join the club.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, the phrase is rarely helpful because it is vague and the wardrobe can vary widely between offices, even in the same field and location - from dark denim and oxford shirts to suits and ties. The best rule of thumb for what you can and should wear is to ask or look at the clothing worn in the office and, while feeling out the limits, stick to dressing towards the more formal end of that spectrum until you know how much flexibility you have.\n",

      "As with any purchase, it is important to decide on a budget.\n",
      "There are some rough guiding opinions about the minimum budget for your items to be the right amount of ‚Äúquality‚Äù relative to price but, in truth, you need to come to a personal estimate of what you can afford, what you need, and how soon/urgently you need particular items.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, try to shop around at different stores.\n",

      "Third, prioritize certain aspects of fit (detailed in the sub-sections) and work with a tailor to nail the rest. Tailors are incredibly helpful and can help turn decent looking clothing into clothing that compliments your build.\n",

The former is usually sized by neck size and sleeve length - when shopping in-store, ask store attendants if there are try-on shirts or if they will help you unpack the shirt or measure you before trying it on. Casual shirts tend to be sized by letter (S, M, L), are shorter in length (allowing them to be worn untucked or tucked), and made of more casual fabrics.\n",

      "It is important to shop around! Different brands will vary in shirt length and body width so [if one brand is too wide](http://i.imgur.com/XtU8BmL.jpg), just try another until you feel comfortable and look good. For untucked shirts, you generally would want the bottom of the shirt to not reach past the middle of your pants zipper. Prioritize fit at the shoulders (having the shoulder seams of the shirt line up with end of your shoulder) and arm width - you can then easily have the length of the shirt tailored if too long and the body slimmed if a bit too wide.\n",

At higher price ranges you get access to different fabrics, construction, craftsmanship (this does not scale linearly with price) and potentially unique styling that you may not find at cheaper price ranges.

      "I think for a setting where the dress code is a tucked in shirt without a blazer, I would start with 5 shirts, 2 chinos, 2 shoes, 2 sweaters, 1 blazer, 1 suit (optional, depending on need).

A thin down jacket you spent $1000 on just won't do the same job as a gigantic $50 synthetic puffer -- the size just helps insulate so effectively that the quality differences don't really compare. And hey, some people like a gigantic puffer. Some people really love them. Those peoples' tastes are just very different from mine.\n",

I come home and noticed it said \"Travel Jean\" on the tag and came to realize there are actually two different lines. I'm questioning my purchase now. If you were me, would you return the $29.99 purchase and spend more towards the retail version? I'm just unsure how much more quality I can get out of the retail version.

I've looked at various stores in-person, and really don't understand the difference in quality compared to price. For example, I went to Suit Supply and Todd Snyder to see their Polos and pants, and while Todd Snyder's silk-linen polos *felt* nicer, both brands were made in China and Todd Snyder's linen pants wrinkled just as easily as Suit Supply...yet Todd Snyder was 2x the price.

Is the quality actually 2 - 5x better and the shirts will last me 2 - 5x longer?

BR came out with an even slimmer fit, the modern slim, a while now but no one has compared it with J Crew's Ludlow. It would only make sense to compare the slimmest fitting suit of one store to that of the other. I know that BR doesn't actually carry their modern slim suits in stores so I can't try for myself.

As such, dress can affect our self-confidence, self-esteem, feelings of worthiness, etc. And historically, men, in the western world at least, have been discouraged from caring much about their appearance.

      "So to stock up on pants, I picked up a couple pairs of Banana Republic‚Äôs Fulton Skinny Chinos when they were having one of their 40% off sales last week. Unfortunately, the Fulton fit is only available at certain stores; I was lucky to find that they were on discount and the prices were much cheaper in store than they were online. I took advantage of the sale and [picked up a few](http://i.imgur.com/JRLhhUO.jpg) Note: The bottom 2 colors are their ‚ÄúGray‚Äù and ‚ÄúPreppy Navy‚Äù colors.\n",

They have a nice taper to them but aren‚Äôt skin-tight; I don‚Äôt feel restricted at all in these pants and don‚Äôt think it is too revealing (which was an unfortunate problem with American Eagle pants).\n",

      "\n",
      "J Crew 484- I *feel* as though the 484 pants are more tapered, although I wouldn‚Äôt go as far to say that the Fulton Chinos are closer to their Urban Slim fit; they are definitely closer to the 484 fit.

      "This is the first thread in a series of threads about building your wardrobe in a specific direction after you have become content with [The Basic Bastard Wardrobe](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1dc/the_basic_bastard_basic_wardrobe_and_inspiration/). For the first iteration, we‚Äôre going to be going over one of /r/malefashionadvice‚Äôs original loves: [workwear](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=workwear%20inspiration&restrict_sr=1). MFA and workwear have had a long and storied relationship, but in recent years it has taken a backseat to things like SLP. Despite that, workwear is still a somewhat popular look that is easily accessible and easy to start wearing when you are coming from the Basic Bastard.\n",
      "\n",
      "This thread is *not* meant to be a comprehensive informational guide on the roots of the Americana & Workwear aesthetic. While that is an interesting topic, and is something I am interested in researching further, this is mainly meant to be an introductory wardrobe expansion guide for those that are new to fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Characteristics\n",
      "\n",
      "I should start by specifying that there is arguably a difference between Americana and workwear. Americana is a style inspired by heritage American clothing, while workwear is a style of clothing that draws from clothing worn by manual laborers. So while a greaser look might not perfectly fit into the aesthetic of workwear, and a french work jacket is not technically Americana, the aesthetics share so many similarities that making two separate guides would be difficult and unnecessary. From here on out, I will be calling the combination of the two aesthetics ‚Äúworkwear,‚Äù even though it would be more technically correct to include both each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, workwear has tough materials and roomier cuts. It is commonly associated with fabrics like denim, flannel, and canvas. Common footwear choices include leather boots and shoes. Common features of garments include tough materials, multiple pockets, and utilitarian roots. These garments were originally created for or chosen because of a combination of durability, utility, and price. A long time has passed since then, though, and fashion brands have drawn inspiration from and appropriated these looks for decades. Aside from manual laborers, plenty of garments have been taken from various militaries and incorporated into everyday fashion. Examples include [M43 jackets](https://www.norsestore.com/shared/91/69/orslow-us-army-jacket_u.jpg) and [breton shirts](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/c7/ec/55c7ecfe140bd96174bf7a984ef77a48.jpg), among many many others. Ideally, the modern versions of these clothes are made in their country of origin or another first\\-world country, and their durability should be on par with the originals.\n",

      "\n",
      "Disclaimer: Some of the brands in this section, especially the ones featured in the one\\-dollar\\-sign budget tier, will likely sell many other things besides clothing that fits the workwear aesthetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### $\n",
      "\n",
      "First, check places like thrift stores, military surplus stores, etsy, and eBay. Items like jeans, flannels, fatigue shirts, and work jackets can all be found for cheap.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Carhartt](https://www.carhartt.com/): A classic workwear brand, Carhartt makes jackets, pants, sweatshirts, and more. Their cuts are a bit boxy, so if you find yourself wanting something that has a more modern and slim fit and you have money to spare, check out their WIP line, which is mentioned in the next budget tier.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Dickies](https://www.dickies.com/): Rugged work pants in a variety of fits at a great price. What‚Äôs not to love? They also make work jackets and shirts, but their pants are what they do best.\n",
      "\n",
      "[J. Crew](https://www.jcrew.com/): J. Crew sells a large variety of clothes, some of them fitting the workwear wardrobe more than others. Most notably, the outerwear section has many items that fit the aesthetic, from pea coats to military parkas. Check back during Fall and Winter months for the best selection. J. Crew‚Äôs clothing is a bit overpriced at retail, so make sure to buy on sale at 30&#37; off or more, which they run often.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Levi‚Äôs](https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/): You know them for their jeans, but Levi‚Äôs also has plenty of other pants, shirts, and jackets (including denim jackets, of course) to complete a basic workwear wardrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "[L.L. Bean](https://www.llbean.com/): A heritage American brand with a previously too\\-lenient return policy, L.L. bean makes solidly constructed clothing and accessories for traversing the great outdoors at very reasonable prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Ralph Lauren](https://www.ralphlauren.com/): Though many MFA members (myself included) prefer other brands, it would be wrong of me to leave Ralph Lauren out of a heritage workwear brands list. RL of course makes polos, and also has a wide range of other shirts, pants, jackets, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### $$\n",
      "\n",
      "[Bleu De Paname](http://www.bleudepaname.com/en/): A brand that makes great work jackets and pants, Bleu De Paname takes inspiration from French workwear.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Carhartt WIP](https://www.carhartt-wip.com/en): The fashion\\-oriented brother of Carhartt, the WIP line is based in Europe, and makes classic workwear and Carhartt garments in more modern cuts. Jackets are less boxy, pants are a bit more tapered, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Gustin](https://www.weargustin.com/): Gustin is a brand with a crowd\\-sourced business model. The quality is great for the price paid, but be aware that you will have to wait for multiple months to actually receive your product. Gustin makes every core item in a wardrobe, from jeans and button\\-up shirts to leather jackets and white sneakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Stan Ray](https://www.stanray.com/): A brand that originally gained notoriety in the fashion world for their fatigue pants, Stan Ray has branched out to make more types of pants, jackets, shorts, and hats.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Taylor Stitch](https://www.taylorstitch.com/collections/all-mens): Taylor Stitch makes clothing that would be good for any Basic Bastard, and they have a solid selection of shirts and pants for a workwear wardrobe, including chambray, denim, and flannel shirts, as well as plenty of overshirts and a couple types of work pants.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### $$$\n",
      "\n",
      "[3sixteen](https://www.3sixteen.com/): Known for their great denim, 3sixteen also makes other staple pieces like shirts and jackets.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Apolis](https://store.apolisglobal.com/): Apolis became popular for their MiUSA chore coats, but makes core wardrobe items like t\\-shirts, button\\-ups, jeans, and chinos.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Filson](https://www.filson.com/men.html): Usually recommended for their bags, Filson also has plenty of great outerwear as well as shirts, pants, and other wardrobe essentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Folk](https://www.folkclothing.com/): A English brand that makes clothing that is workwear\\-inspired rather than strictly workwear. Great small details and more minimal than most of the other brands listed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Rogue Territory](https://www.rogueterritory.com/): Like the other brands on this list, Rogue Territory makes anything a wardrobe could need besides footwear. Their Supply Jackets are their most well\\-known item.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Universal Works](https://universalworks.co.uk/): A UK\\-based brand that makes contemporary workwear. They have plenty of great pieces for any Basic Bastard and Basic Bastard graduates alike.\n",

      "\n",
      "Workwear is an easy style to get into not only because the wardrobe is basically an expansion pack of the Basic Bastard that can easily be added on to the base wardrobe, but because of its roots during the era of industrialization. Because of this, is it an aesthetic that attracts newcomers and does not usually cause those who are unfamiliar with fashion to have a distaste for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Future Iterations of Beyond the Basic Bastard\n",
      "\n",
      "What aesthetics would you like to see covered in the future, and which specific one would you like to see next? Maybe you would even like me to separate some of the categories instead of doing them in a single thread. There are plenty of possible looks to cover.\n",
      "\n",

The instructions state to machine wash warm and to tumble dry medium, but I'm a bit skeptical as I followed the instructions for BR's soft-wash cotton tee and that shrunk a good amount... Not so much that it's unwearable, but it's a bit snug and definitely too short in length. I don't mind the chinos shrinking in width, I actually want it to shrink in width a bit, but I'm afraid the length will shrink by too much. I'm actually new to this sub but it's been pretty helpful.

I'm good with computers, but that doesn't make me feel especially cool. And I'm not, like, opposed to emotions, or anything like that. And I'm mostly fine with that... But I need a little something. So I'm going to take traditional masculinity where I can get it. I was often told that I really knew how to wear a suit -- so when a couple of friends started talking to me about lapel widths and pick stitching... I was a little rattled. Suits were something that I thought accounted for my emotional, musical-loving ass, 5'6 stature, high-pitched voice, and all. So I had to do some research. I needed to learn how to talk about suits.\n",

But, let me put it this way: cashmere is a type of wool, but if you have cashmere, you don't use the word wool. A tuxedo is a type of suit, but you won't call it that most of the time. And the reason is... Tuxedos and \"**lounge suits**\" (or \"regular\" suits, or, if you they're dark colors, \"**business suits**\") are used for *completely different* reasons. A lot of people don't realize this, so let me dig in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuxedos are for **parties**. \"Lounge suits\" are, confusingly, for **serious business**. A lounge suit is *supposed* to be a little boring. It's supposed to make you look put together, the way you want your accountant to look for the five minutes you meet with him -- and then you go home, and think, \"that guy really has my money safe.\" [Don't wear a tux to a business meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FOk4bCAQhc). And as common as it is, it's a little funny to wear a lounge suit to a wedding -- particularly if the invite says \"**black tie**,\" which basically means \"your suit should be a tuxedo.\" \"**Black tie optional**\" is what most people see when they read the words \"black tie.\" And I mean, that makes sense, because a lot of people can't afford to own both tuxes and lounge suits, and a lot of people need lounge suits. But the effect of all this is, when you see a tux, you think, *damn, now that guy came to party*.\n",

If you wear white tie to a black tie event, you're going to look silly -- you're going to look like a stuffy old British butler. But if you get invited to a white tie event, or an event whose invitation demands morning dress, you'd best follow the rules. There are also **stroller suits**, which are kind of morning suits, but less formal, but still more formal than a lounge suit. White tie is generally reserved for royal events, balls, and other fancy events. Some musicians below report that they've had to wear white tie for their roles in certain events.

      "A single breasted jacket (I'll explain what that means later) might have one, two, or three buttons... don't have more than three. Sometimes, you'll see a \"**three roll two**,\" which means \"three buttons, but the top one is on the bottom of the lapel, right around where it rolls.\" This is actually not nearly as weird as it sounds. The button isn't supposed to be buttoned, but it's a detail that, for some arbitrary reason, suit nerds like. While we're talking about it, suit nerds *love* talking about [**the lapel roll**](https://i.imgur.com/klKoR8D.jpg).\n",
      "\n",
      "The lapel should have what looks like a buttonhole in it meant for boutonnieres (those flowery things). Cheap suits might skip that hole, or include it but not even bother making it functional. Nice, handmade suits might have a [**Milanese button hole**](https://imgur.com/wnKYRz8), which involves a few hours of hand-sweing... Yes, for just the buttonhole. Sounds wasteful, huh?\n",
      "\n",
      "The jacket also often has a few pockets, and they're mostly for show. You'll almost certainly have a left breast pocket on the exterior for show or for pocket squares. You're also likely to have an interior pocket or two -- I usually see one on the left side. These are useful for a small item like a slim wallet or passport or kippah (or yarmulke, for you Yiddish folks). As for side pockets: \"**Flap pockets**\" are the most common thing you'll see -- they're the flaps on the sides of suits, and the pockets under them. They're formal and standard. \"**Patch Pockets\"** are just kind of sewn on top, and look casual. \"**Jetted Pockets**\" are sleek little slits in the side -- those are generally good for tuxes. A \"**ticket pocket**\" is a funny little detail like the 3-roll-2 thing above -- it's an extra pocket above your right pocket, which, once upon a time, was used just for train tickets. Yeah, I don't get it either.\n",
      "\n",
      "There might be \"**vents**\" in the back of the jacket that might help you move more freely without shoving the jacket around. Zero, one, or two vents are all reasonable. I'll let you pick what you like. Center vents are historically related to horseback riding, so they're not appropriate for eveningwear.\n",

      "And your suit's sleeves have **cuffs**. Hopefully these cuffs have buttons on them. Those buttons might just be for show, or they might be functional (\"**surgeon's cuff**\"). If you're going to get a cheap suit, it's actually better if they aren't functional, because that makes your sleeve length easier (cheaper) to tailor. If you get an expensive suit, functional cuffs are a good idea. Some people like a contrasting buttonhole on one of the buttons... But I don't. Eh. It's a flashy detail. The buttons might be super close or not even touch.\"**Kissing**\" buttons barely touch. Those are good, because they vaguely imply handwork. \"**Stacked**\" buttons are practically on top of one another.\n",

You don't really need anything, but at the very least, it's good to have **side adjusters**, which might be buttons or metal slidey things on the sides of the waist that help you tighten them up after they're already on. Or, you can have little buttons inside that connect to **suspenders** or **braces** \\-- those are great, but **shouldn't be seen** \\-- wear a jacket or sweater or something on top of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trousers also have a fly, usually with a zipper and either a button or a slidey thing (or both). Hopefully, some part of the closure is off-center, which helps everything stay in put because... idk, torque something something. There's a word for this. What's the word?\n",
      "\n",
      "The ankle part of your trousers will either be **cuffed** or not. \"Cuffed\" here means that the bottom is folded up, but not the way you roll up your jeans -- no, it's folded up by the tailor, and since your pants are tailored to your length, it looks intentional. This comes down to personal preference.\n",

      "I'd prefer you didn't wear one, but if you must... A **vest** or **waistcoat** has a front facing made of your suit's body/shell material, and a back facing that is probably made of the same thing as the lining, I think, I don't really know.

A tuxedo will have a separate material for its lapel facings and stripe. We're going to talk about the canvas in construction, but essentially, it's supposed to be made of horsehair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **bodies** or **shells** of most decent suits are made of **worsted wool**. Wool might include **mohair** or **cashmere** or **vicuna**, but if it does, you'll know it. What the fuck does **worsted** mean? Well, a lot of things -- it's twisted and treated and some such... but the most tangible definition is... It's the suit stuff. You know. The kind of wool they make suits out of. Yeah. That stuff. Specifically, the worsting process involves treating and twisting the wool so that it's kind of... less fluffy, if that makes sense. You might describe it as \"hard,\" which... you know it's not hard, but it's harder than woolen. **Woolen** refers to the softer type of wool yarn.\n",

[Wool is fucking great](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/7hqusm/materials_talk_part_2_properties_of_wool_the/). I love wool. Guys, guys, guys. Wooooool. It's warm, but breathable. It's wrinkle-resistant. It handles water well, but repels odors by magically destroying germs, even though nobody asked it to. It's durable enough to justify its cost at all tiers. And it's easy to care for. You almost never *need* to take wool to the dry cleaner, unless it gets stained or really stinks. You might clean denim more often than you do wool.

      "You will often see a \"**super number**\" in a suit's description, such as 120s or 150s. \"Super\" is an old marketing term that described really good wool. All you need to know now is: 100s is thick (good for winter), 150s is **fine** (thin, good for summer). Anything finer than 150s is generally not recommended, since it will wear very quickly and feel flimsy. Such fine fabrics are generally very expensive. Everything from 100s-150s is within standard range, but \\~120s is a good weight for a versatile, affordable, quality suit that will last a long time.\n",

      "As with everything, there are some suits made of cheap **polyester**. Don't buy one of those if you can avoid it. You'll bake, and smell, and look bad, and it's really not *too* hard to find a cheap wool suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cotton** is also usually cheap. It doesn't handle moisture or odor well, so you'll need to get it cleaned very often. It wrinkles more than wool. It's not as breathable as wool (in case you wanna go unlined). Cotton kinda sucks in all the ways wool is amazing. Sometimes it's used in blends with linen. It can also take the form of **chino** or **seersucker**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, you'll hear people talking about a **chino** suit. Chino is a type of cotton fabric that you can feel if you have a pair of chinos. If you have a pair of **khakis**, those are chinos in an ugly color. If you have **cargo pants**, those are probably chinos with ugly pockets. You know what chino is now, right? , but it's not so formal -- a little wrinkly, and stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've also heard of **seersucker**, maybe -- yeah, sounds funny, right? **Seersucker** is a kind of crunchy cotton. Seersucker is pretty breathable and pretty wrinkly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Linen** is amazing, but not ideal for suits. Linen wrinkles like crazy. If you look up photos of linen suits, you will see **nothing but lies**. That's what a linen suit looks like the moment you put it on, and then you move and it is wrinkled beyond the domain of the world's most powerful iron. That said, you might see some linen blends with cotton or silk where this downside is mitigated. Oh man, I tried a linen/silk blend unstructured double breasted blazer from Ring Jacket a couple of weeks ago, and... *stay focused, /*u/danhakimi*, you're on a mission*. The main upside of linen is that it will breathe amazingly, and you'll stay cool wearing it in the summer, and you'll fall asleep and wake up and think *ugh, everything should be linen*. it's also pretty good with odor, and generally just magical, except for the wrinkling.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Wool blends** might be a few different things. They might be a blend of wool with bad things like polyester -- avoid these if you can. They might be a blend of wool with good things, like linen or **silk** \\-- those are tricky, and unique. They might wrinkle, or they might not. Other blends exist too -- I've been seeing some linen/silk blends recently, and desperately want something like that unstructured. You'll see cotton/linen and a few other things too. And you might just see a blend of different kinds of wool, like a wool-cashmere blend. Cashmere doesn't generally last as long as other kinds of wool, but it's soft and warm and expensive, so... Go for it, if you can.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Unlined** suits (which are sometimes but not necessarily **unstructured**) are awesome. They breathe nicely and feel soft. They'll be finished on the inside with the same material as the body. You can also go half lined, but I'd personally go all or nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the lining is sometimes nice too. It adds a little weight, structure, and insulation. It puts an extra layer between you and your suit and your body, which *might* help if you sweat a lot. Finally, it's a chance to give your suits a unique touch, especially if you want to customize them -- your lining is usually invisible, but the tiny flashes make for a very slight accent, even if you go with a funky color or loud pattern. It *might* even be cheaper to use lining, since you don't need to worry about finishing the interior in wool.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Polyester** doesn't breathe. A lot of suit makers cheap out, and even if the body is wool, they'll use polyester linings. That sucks. Polyester sucks. You'll bake in it. Or even in the winter, it isn't comfortable. It will probably last forever, though.\n",

      "\n",
      "# Construction\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so the first thing suit nerds want to talk about every morning is canvas. Canvas is a magical thing in between the outer layer and inner layer of your suit. This helps give the suit its shape. A suit is supposed to provide your body with some structure -- that's especially important on flabby men like me, but still looks good on, you know, Daniel Craig. Quality horsehair canvas will mold to your body over time and fit better and look better and make you happier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheap suits might use a \"**fused**\" or \"**fusible**\" canvas, which might be synthetic and connected to the suit with glue. This causes the jacket to move in a silly way -- the parts that are supposed to move together don't, or the parts that are supposed to move independently don't, or both. And when you get them dry cleaned, the glue might cause shitty bubbles. So a fused suit is cheap and not very good. (If you're between a fused wool suit and a half canvassed polyester suit, I vote wool. Wool is great. Polyester sucks.) Macy's and JCF make these as well as anybody in the $150 range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, you have middle ground #1, which is a \"**floating chest piece**.\" These use a little bit of horse hair, but only in the chest. It doesn't reach the lapels, or the bottom of the jacket. These are somewhat uncommon. Some people will sell them, but advertise them as half canvassed, because they're jerks. Off the top of my head, Banana Republic sells a floating chest piece, for roughly $300 on sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, you have **half canvassed** suits. These are canvassed in the chest and lapels, which causes the lapels to roll in a cool way. That's good. SuitSupply sells these in the $400-$500 range. The parts that aren't canvased don't really need much shape anyway, but they might wear a little faster than the chest, and that's not ideal. The parts that aren't canvased, in this case, are generally fused, which sucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The top tier here would be **full canvas** (aka **canvassed** by elitists who view everything as either fused or canvased). That is the whole body (not including the arms or pants). This will last longer, and look marginally better, but cost more. Up to you if you want to splurge. These *usually* cost more than $500.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, off to the side, you have **unstructured** suits with no canvas or padding (or very little). They are often also unlined, which means the jacket is really just shell. These are, as you might have guessed, less structured and more flowy. They're lighter and more breathable (obviously, since you got rid of layers). They're on the casual side, but not necessarily too casual. They feel great. Ugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shoulders often have some amount of **padding**. Unstructured suits often have none. Italian-style suits have little. British-style suits have a lot. A formal suit should at least have some. This relates to preference, but also to other details, and whether you want a cohesive suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pick stitching** is very subtle but visible stitching you can see around the outer edge of your lapels. It signifies that the lapels were hand-padded. You want this. You might think it looks funny, but you definitely want it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I forget the word for it, but nice handmade trousers will have a little corner thing at the sides which... I think helps keep the pants flexible? Somebody remind me what this is called and what it's for.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might have noticed a pattern by now. A lot of details are thought to be \"better\" because they have to be made by hand. Spending four hours on one button hole is silly. So when you see a button hole that was stitched by hand for four hours, you know that *somebody* has *waaaay* too much money. You want to look like you have way too much money... and you know how to use it on things that fancy people like. That is a good thing.\n",

You should consider how much [**belly**](http://www.bondsuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Shawl-Collar-Belly.jpg) your shawl lapel has.

      "Confusingly, **single breasted** jackets have two breasts. The majority of jackets you see out there are single breasted. The defining characteristic is that there is one vertical row of buttons (or one button) that shows up at the edge of the right breast for men, or the left breast for women (particularly wealthy women from back in the day when your servants buttoned your jacket while facing you). This creates a very small overlap between the breasts.\n",

      "**Double breasted**, by contrast, refers to two vertical rows of buttons, and a large overlap. Recently, some companies have been using \"**1.5 breasted**\" as a corny marketing term for a double breasted jacket where the overlap is not that large, and the vertical rows of buttons are closer.

They shouldn't have notch lapels, less because it's wrong, and more because lounge suits have notch lapels, and you don't want to look like a boring accountant, you want to look like you came to party. Peak or shawl. Again, they can be single or double breasted, but a double breasted tuxedo is a real oddity. Generally, you want a one button tuxedo.

      "Suits come in **off the rack** (or **off the peg**, or **ready to wear** \\-- **otr** or **rtw)**, **made to measure** (or **mtm**), and **bespoke**. Off the rack suits come in fixed sizes. Made to measure involves a lot of measurements that are then sent abroad for cheap labor on a pretty good suit with some amount of personal customization. Bespoke involves multiple rounds of measurement and fitting over months with an amazing local tailor who will make you an insanely good suit that fits perfectly and can be customized however you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary size for any suit jacket is defined by **chest** and **length**. But the primary length \"measurement\" is just a choice between **regular**, **long**, and **short**. This length covers both the body and sleeve. **Sleeves** are pretty easy to tailor, so don't even trip about those, plan on getting them tailored. Functioning buttonholes are actually a little bit harder to tailor, but still not that hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Body length** is a little trickier, since it also relates to **button stance**. Button stance is where the top button on the jacket sits on your body. I typically wear a 40s. If I got a 40L and shortened the sleeves and shortened the body, I'd still have an issue, in that the buttons would be waaaay down there. This can theoretically be tailored, but don't plan on it -- your tailor would have to sew over and redo buttonholes, shift the lapels, maybe move pockets, and do a bunch of other stuff you don't want done, even if your tailor is willing to try. Just get a jacket with a good button stance, and good body length.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Button Stance** itself is important. It generally refers to the position of the top button that you're supposed to use, or the \"buttoning point.\" For example, it would refer to the second button on a 3-roll-2 jacket. It should usually be around your natural waist, but shifting it up or down might be good if you want to shift proportions: a higher stance shortens your torso and lengthens your legs, and a lower stance lengthens your torso and shortens your legs. Some people also use the term \"button stance\" to refer to the distance between buttons, which is more interesting in double breasted jackets than single breasted ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **shoulder** fit is also very important. You won't see it reflected in sizing, and it's usually kept in some proportion to your chest, so if your chest and shoulders are not standard proportions, you might have a slight issue with off-the-rack suits. This is **very** hard to tailor, so get it right the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lapel width** is a different issue -- not really so much about fit, but proportion, and style. They're measured at the widest point. Skinny lapels are out -- they were a brief modern style. A classic suit as a decent sized lapel. Your tie width (at the widest point) should, in theory, match your lapel width. Note that this really transforms some of the above lapel styles. Slim peak versus super wide peak lapels are very different. Some shawl lapels go deep, and others are sleeker and cleaner (I like the latter, but the former is more classic).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it's worth mentioning **arm holes**. Not eye holes, no, arm holes. The hole at your shoulder that goes to your arm. You don't want them to be baggy. Off the rack, and even made to measure, these are going to have a little give, and go a little lower than your actual armpit. Off the rack, they have to fit everybody. MTM, they're still following a pattern and this is just a detail they won't handle. Bespoke tailors, on the other hand, can give you high, narrow arm holes, which will move beautifully with your body and help keep your posture and just make everything better. Ugh, I want a bespoke suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arm hole's seam is called the [**sleeve head**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_Juf2oINMI). Sven explains sleeve heads better in that video than I can in text. Again, these are something you'll worry about more when you get into customizing a suit, or buying unstructured suits, but some off-the-rack bands do interesting things with shoulder padding and structure, so even if you're just going to SuitSupply, it's worth understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for **pants**, we're worrying about **waist**, **inseam**, **break**, and **rise**.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're buying off the rack, **waist** is the first number. I generally wear a 32/30, which means a 32 waist. You know what pant waists are. (Your suit also exists at your waist, so this measurement is relevant to a good suit fit, but since they're sized by the chest, that relates more to your fit, off the rack).\n",
      "\n",
      "The second number is **inseam**, which is kind of code for length. But it's the length of the seam on the inside -- IE, from your crotch down to your ankles. Where on your angles? That depends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want your pants **cropped**, or too short to meet your shoes when standing? That's pretty casual, I wouldn't recommend it. If you do it, you want your pants pretty slim. You can have **no break**, which means they just barely touch your shoes, or don't, but end right there, you know? That's a modern/young look -- perhaps too much so. A **slight break**, where the pants hit your shoes a little, is still pretty modern and young without looking bad to the partners at your firm. A **medium break** hits your shoes a little more, and starts to fold a bit, and is good, classic, and perfect for the partner, unless he's an old man, in which case he might try a **full break**, which really folds at the ankles and over the shoes. Pants with a full break should not be slim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that inseam and break are probably the easiest things in the world to tailor. So again, don't sweat it when buying. A lot of brands sell pant legs unfinished, so you can handle this (and also decide whether you want to cuff the leg or not).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if the inseam is the length under the crotch, what's the length from waist to crotch? For some reason, that's called the **rise**. A lower-medium rise is pretty standard these days, and sits in the same place as most of your pants sit, above your hips. A high rise sits at your \"natural waist,\" above your belly button, and is pretty classic, believe it or not. If you want to be talked into a high rise, go read [https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/](https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Off the rack suits *sometimes* have separate sizes for jackets and pants, but *sometimes* just tell you the jacket size and assume what your pants size would be. They call the difference between these sizes your \"**drop**.\" If you have an unusually large or small drop, that really sucks. Either go for the brands that will sell you separate sizes, or go made to measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we can talk about **fit**. You don't want your suit too **skinny**. You're not buying it to go to hipster bars in Brooklyn. So you can go **slim** and modern, or **regular** and classic. Or **relaxed**. If you're buying off the rack, you want to use this to try to match your body and get something that actually fits well. If you're going MTM or bespoke, you know your suit is going to fit you, so you want to pick based on style -- not whether it fits, but *how* it fits. Do you want it to hang and flow a little more? Do you want to look tight and put together? I mean, you will look put together either way, but... You know, talk to your tailor, see where you want to land.\n",

The problem is, that was 5 years ago and I was about 30 years old and life has caught up to me and I need to size up. I love the material of these suits (each probably retailed for $1000+ or so) and the value I paid for them ($3-400). SS hasn‚Äôt had an outlet sale since 2020 and I really don‚Äôt want to pay full price unless I have to. My favorite thing about SS are the fit and feel & look of the material. What are some brands you have found to be at/better quality? Ideally I would pay somewhere around the $500 range on sale but willing to spend more, if needed. I don‚Äôt mind waiting around for sales, just trying to get familiar with good quality brands to look for. If SuitSupply not on sale is still that brand I should strive for, that is also an acceptable answer. \n",

      "Description: Now that we are in the middle of summer, I think I've seen enough of what the spring and summer trends are this year\n",
      "\n",
      "Check out my previous guide on my Japanese fall/winter thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/lc8sij/japanese_winter_fashion_trend_20202021/)\n",
      "\n",
      "***Who am I***\n",
      "\n",
      "Just  some guy who lives in Japan and travels all over the country because of  work (I plan airports and rail). So I see the styles from Hokkaido to  Okinawa. From big cities like Tokyo's wards, and small rural areas. I do  live right next to a major shopping area in the center of my city, so I  tend to be exposed to what youth are wearing and of course, the salary  man.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is based on MY own personal observations. (I'm sure there's gonna be some one here with another observation).\n",
      "\n",
      "As  for the examples.I had thought about just standing at the main station  and taking photos, but not sure if it violates any privacy issues, so  gonna use pics from forums and fashion sites that match what I see.\n",
      "\n",
      "***What this covers***\n",
      "\n",
      "This covers trends based on what I am seeing every day in Japan.   Most of the fashion trends tend to be spearheaded by young adults from their late teens to their 20s and early 30s.  This does NOT cover some of the niche Japanese brands that many in MFA tend to seek.  This is just mainstream things that the average Japanese are wearing and the brands they generally prefer. So no Issey Miyake, Needles, etc.  and More towards common mall brands like Beams, United Arrows, Ships, Uniqlo, Global Works, etc.  This is also based purely on my own observations and conversations, not any list or ranking or anything like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "***Background: Japan is a country of uniforms***\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean this in the most literal and metaphorical sense. Many Japanese are in some kind of uniform from birth to adulthood.  A child they may be wearing bright yellow or red hats as part of a safety uniform for school children, transitions to school uniforms in their teenage years, then donning some form of work wear as an adult, whether its a suit or some other work wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "This generally leaves weekends and the college years as periods to show more freedom of expression, yet Japan is a country where many follow trends. So in the end, many people end up wearing the same things. There was a Suzuki? (motorcycle) commercial where a young man showed up to a Gokkon (group date), but all the young men were wearing the same clothes (a sweater with a chestercoat and a wide-brim hat, which was the trend around 2016), and the girls wearing the same things. He got frustrated at this lack of individuality and left the group date to ride on a motorcycle off to the wilderness.  I felt that this was a good video that highlighted how strictly people in Japan follow trends and that there can sometimes be a lack of individuality.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, wearing certain clothes carries strong association with certain groups.  For example if you follow a lot of the popular trends, you will be associated with college aged late teens and 20 somethings.  If you wear ill-fitting pants and checkered shirts, you will be associated with the nerds/geeks.  If you dress in somewhat professional looking clothing but wear dark colored shirts, you will be associated with the night life industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, for non-Japanese, especially those who don't even live in Japan, or are in Japan but look visibly foreign, generally speaking, the \"rules\" don't apply to you.  Locals will notice you more for your foreign facial features than your clothes to be quite frank.  If you're non-Japanese but could pass as Japanese looking, then the Japanese will likely judge you.  In any case, you should wear whatever you want, this is just to explain the background behind Japanese society and fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, most of the fashion trends (which tends to change every 2-4 years, is happening with the young adult groups. You won't see that much changes for people over 50. That group, if they haven't resigned to dad-wear, are still rocking things that were popular 20 years ago liked popped polo collars and Abercrombie and Fitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "***What is Trending***\n",
      "\n",
      "**Casual suits** \\- While Japan always had casual suits. the stuff that's popular these days are a bit different.  They tend to be either in nontraditional business colors, such as light grey, purple, etc, and/or very wide fits.  Usually both. I've seen a sharp increase in this style this year\n",

      "[pic](https://c.imgz.jp/254/45560254/45560254_46_d_500.jpg)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Checked patterns** \\- I think this is a trend that started maybe 3 years ago and is slowly fading away, but there's still quite a few people wearing it.  This tends to apply more towards bottoms (shorts and pants)\n",
      "\n",
      "[pic](https://cdn.wimg.jp/coordinate/betie2/20181108230903373/20181108230903373_500.jpg)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Wide fit, oversized anything** \\- after trending towards slim and tight fits in the 2010s, Japanese youth have now went the other direction and are wearing oversized everything.  Tops bottoms, etc. Especially in the summer\n",
      "\n",
      "[pic](https://images.wear2.jp/coordinate/ROiJLJDG/y4XBHFpH/1628027027_1000.jpg)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Wide fit top, slim bottoms** \\- while it seemed that slim fitting wear was about to fade out.. it started coming back again, but just the bottoms.. paired with an oversized top\n",
      "\n",
      "[pic](https://tasclap.k-img.com/icv/450/tasclapimage_4892_11_1.jpg?d=20200924115023)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Name brand tees** \\- this is not really a trend, but was always popular.  Usually for guys between mid 20s to 40s (when people start entering the work force).  A plain simple t-shirt, but with a recognized logo (usually Lacoste, Ralph Lauren, Fred Perry or North Face.. sometimes Abercrombie and Fitch). Unlike MFA, the Japanese still like logos of famous foreign brands.  But they dont like it to be super huge like in some other neighboring countries.  Just a small normal logo is sufficient\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Whatever BTS is wearing** \\- For decades, Japan and Korea went in separate directions when it came to fashion trends.  But because of groups like BTS and Twice (for girls), its now merging.  Although BTS has been around for years, it seems only within the last two years, they became very very big in Japan. Now many youth are following whatever BTS wears, and cutting their hair in the same style.\n",
      "\n",
      "[pic](https://manofmany.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BTS-Member-Style-Guide.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tucking in your shirt** \\- whether its a button shirt or tee, tucking in your shirt has been popular (especially for some wider fits).  thanks to BTS\n",
      "\n",
      "[pic](https://cdn.wimg.jp/coordinate/36u6j1/20210606100156765/20210606100156765_500.jpg)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Less Bombers, more collars** \\- for some time collar less designs were a big trend.  bomber jackets, stand collar shirts, etc.  slowly but surely it has shifted towards collars again.  So rather than bomber jackets, collared jackets such as coaches jackets are becoming more popular. (i personally still prefer bombers and will keep on wearing them)\n",
      "\n",
      "[pic](https://c.imgz.jp/268/28803268/28803268B_8_D_500.jpg)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Relaxing of summer business casual** \\- Most of Japan can get very hot and humid in the summer, and despite that people were wearing suits all year round.  This changed in 2011 after the triple disasters in Japan. Due to the desire to reduce reliance on energy, a series of cuts were promoted, one of which meant reducing A/C use.  This meant summer dress codes were relaxed.  Short sleeve shirts, polo shirts, and kariyushi wear (an Okinawan version of the Aloha shirt, which has different patterns such as shiisa..an okinawan lion dog, or sugar cane) were allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first they were pretty conservative, such as polo shirts that had stiff button down collars, and were lengthy, to be worn tucked in.  But these days, even regular polo shirts are allowed. This applies even to some very conservative work areas, such as the area I work in.  But its mainly being worn by younger guys who are usually slimmer and in better shape to pull it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trendier business casual polos still must be in conservative colors.  White, light blue, light grey. Navy and Black with light colored pants are also okay (and the only time a dark colored top could be acceptable for business casual.  in other seasons, it would be associated with the night industries).  Pale pink is also okay, but less common.    They should be solid colors and plain. no logos, or small logos from well known brands (lacoste, ralph lauren, fred perry) are acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "They can be worn untucked but the length needs to be short and the shirt slim.  As a result you mostly see younger employees wearing this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that you will still need to rock a suit and proper dress shirt during very important events such as interviews or key meetings. but likely 95% of your work day in the office, this is now acceptable\n",
      "\n",
      "[pic](https://k2j-web.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lacoste-polo-shirt-white_beams-slacks_asics-business-shoes_coordinate-8-1-scaled-e1607499044926.jpg) and [pic2](https://so-school.tokyo/wp16a/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/968977FA-CA30-4B52-AFF9-BD42006F2963.jpeg)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sling bags/waist bags/crossbody bags/fanny packs** \\- whatever you want to call them.  They are getting popular now!  Replacing those hideous super long wallets that people would put in their back pockets 5-10 years ago (and easy for theft).  However younger people wear them diagonally, either in the front or back.  wearing them on your waist is associated with older men.\n",

      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "**Techy Business Casual -** when people think of techwear, they either think of that urban ninja out fit, or regular clothes that have more functional aspects incorporated into them (moisture wicking, stretch, etc).  This refers to the latter.  With the relaxing of summer business casual wear, comes the increase in popularity of more techy business casual clothes.  chinos and dress pants that are stretchy and feel like sweatpants, shirts that are stretchy and moisture wicking, etc.  Some popular brands include Uniqlo's Kando line and Smart line (sorry these are the Japanese name, dont know what it is in other countries), United Arrows Worktrip Outfits, some of Banana Republic's new items, among many others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain patterns and cuts can even pass as regular business clothes. (for example Uniqlo's Kando pants and jacket set in grey has the right texture and color.  The other colors wouldnt work as they are too shiny)\n",
      "\n",
      "[pic](https://bizspa.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_4761.jpg)\n",
      "\n",
      "***Trending Brands***\n",
      "\n",
      "**The North Face** \\- like in my winter guide, North Face is having a HUUUGE surge in popularity right now.  They always were popular, but this past two years it has increased even more.  This may be due to fatigue of other brands like Canada Goose which were too prolific and  became associated with another demographics group (think foreign) that the Japanese don't want to be associated with. Keep in mind that North Face of Japan is a separate company from North Face global.  Its actually owned by a Japanese company called Goldwin which license the name from The North Face.  So what is being sold in Japanese north face stores are exclusive to Japan.  Japanese North Face produces a lot more casual clothes in addition to outdoor clothes, so their summer time clothes are still being worn.  It is also a LOT more expensive (think 150 USD for a pair of tech pants and 600 USD for a down parka).  From my personal experience the quality is very good, but for those concerned about its ethics, unfortunately not sure if they follow anything such as responsible down, or anything.  They are not as transparent as US North Face or brands like Arcteryx, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lacoste** \\- like North Face, its another brand that always had some stable popularity but has increased recently.  Lacoste produces some Japan exclusives which I feel tend to be better in quality (I'm wearing a 6 year old Japan Lacoste polo as we speak and it looks nearly good as new).  Japan Lacoste also does collaborations with other Japanese brands\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ralph Lauren** \\- You know when you go to a Ralph Lauren outlet, all the good colors are gone, as well as the best sizes?  all that is left behind are shirts in bright colors, and/or oversized shirts?  Well youth are now buying those oversized shirts!  especially for Ralph Lauren\n",
      "\n",
      "[pic](https://base-ec2if.akamaized.net/w=640,a=0,q=90,u=1/images/item/origin/51e5b52e6ed175fdf11df9cd43fd4cce.jpg)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Uniqlo U** \\- well Uniqlo is always popular for basics, but the Uniqlo U line generally reflects the current trends among youth in Japan.   Many people go here for their basics such as oversized tees.  One side the Japanese dont like is that Uniqlo U stuff is generally well known and sometimes people here don't like wearing the more distinguishable items (ironic since people here want to look like everyone, but dont to wear the same thing as some one else)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nerdy** \\- I wouldnt say its a huge increase in popularity but it is noticeable. A  lot of this is thanks to the popularity of KPOP groups like BTS and aggressive social media marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Banana Republic** \\- There was a time I thought that this brand would die out in Japan, as its stores were closing. I thought Gap would be the only brand from this group that would survive.  Fast forward to the 2020s, its Gap that is closing down and Banana Republic expanding.  The market for BR In Japan tends to focus on professionals in their 30s and 40s.  They've been doing a lot more of that business-casual tech stuff, such as super stretchy chinos, wrinkle resistant stretchy button shirts, etc.  This brand is not where you go to for the popular youth trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "***Declining Brands***\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fred Perry** \\- in the mid 2010s, Fred Perry polos were the rage with everyone wearing them.  Since then there's been a sharp decline in people wearing Fred Perry.  No it has nothing to do with the Proud boys (people here likely have no idea what they are).  But likely fatigue of the brand, as it really was everywhere.  It does feel that because of that, FP here has been a bit more aggressive in marketing campaigns and sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Champion** \\- like Fred Perry, there was a sharp rise followed by a sharp decline.  You still see it around but its nowhere near as prominent as before, like 4 or 5 years ago\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "***What the Japanese are NOT wearing***\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes on social media I get ads for the \"latest Japanese urban street wear\".\n",
      "a lot of it has no basis in reality.  Most of the time its the same re-branded clothes coming from China.  For starters, the Japanese tend to think foreign stuff is cooler, so wearing clothes that looks too similar to traditional Japanese wear, or with large characters, is seen as tacky.  If you see that the item has a very Japanese sounding name, then its likely not from Japan (they like strange foreign sounding things)\n",
      "\n",

      "Description: I've gone to most department stores and tried almost all their brands and they have all had boxy fits. I have narrow shoulders, and the only collared shirts that have worked for me are J. Crew and Banana Republic XS Slim. My only shirts are from there, and I want to branch out. Any suggestions for stores for shirts that have similar fittings?\n",
