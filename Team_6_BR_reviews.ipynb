It all started when I got my new card.  I called to make sure I could use it in Canada.  I was reassured a note was made that it could be used out of the US. Needless to say after spending over $500 my card was declined and NOBODY could understand why etc.  So I used another card!  The only reason I did that was because my daughter is a teacher and being very petite it is hard to purchase clothes.  I come back and once again tried to use my card for more purchases and just like Canada is said declined.  On and on with phone calls... finally one BR representative was able to give me some type of TEMPORARY # to place the new order.  Let's just say that after that \"success\" NOBODY not even a supervisor could fix my problem.  Not to mention I was on hold for 15 minutes waiting for her to resolve the issue. Which seemed promising @ the beginning of the call. DO NOT DEAL WITH THEM.  Or maybe do not get their credit card.  Not worth the aggravation or spending hours trying to resolve an issue caused by them!!1\n",

The other big complaint seems to center around delivery delays, and that's a 3rd party issue which can't be dumped in BR's lap IMOI'll tell you what's infuriated me to the point of no return: I scanned their site regularly for specials and Banana Republic began to indicate that there was \"Low Stock\" on the items I was interested in. The fact that I got this message on EVERY product I clicked on should have aroused my suspicionsBut I naively believed them and immediately bought them all at full price. I was happy to do soMonths and months later, ALL the garments were still available in copious quantities, and discounted several times overIt's not so much the money as it is the dishonesty and the deceptive, manipulative business practices regarding product availability that really soured me on the brandNever expected my money back when a sale price dropped after I'd purchased something, or lightning fast delivery either- especially when it's included at no charge - but I expected more integrity than this I'm sure I'm not the last good customer they'll lose over these kind of shenanigans\n",

      "Review: I’m surprised with all the bad reviews for Banana Republic.  I buy from them a few times a month.  Yes, the clothes are on the pricey side, but, they are made from linen, wool, silk, leather, suede—all being luxury materials.  Yes, their “final sales—no returns accepted” is a strict policy, but often prices are marked way down because of it and I either don’t shop those items—if size/fitting is in any way an issue.  They have styles that are hard to come by in other online shoppes and the return to their original styles is a serious ++.  My only qualms would be to not have so many cropped sizes on shirts and not such voluminous pants as most reviews on those items show that’s not a big fav with many of us.  Other than that, love them!\n",

I can’t even figure out my size in the stores anymore. The fits have names associated with them that hurt not help you figure out what you should try on, and often means you have to try the same shirt or pant in too many sizes. Also, they have made all the sizes smaller, even an XXL shirt is smaller than an XL in most brands. Quality has become super inconsistent too, becoming Old Navy with higher prices.\n",

      "Review: BR Factory claims on their website that it honors a one-time price adjustment within 14 days from order date.  I placed an order on Monday night and by Tuesday morning, BR Factory already had another promotion on top of the already discounted price.  When I called on Wednesday to get a price adjustment (mind you my order has not even been shipped out yet), the customer service agent told me that they could not honor the price adjustment because extra promotions do not count as price mark downs.  Essentially the company policy plays with words to make you believe they honor price adjustments but in reality they really do not.  All they will offer is to give me a future coupon (10%) so that hopefully I will spend more money with them.  NOPE, I declined the coupon and will not buy anything from BR ever again.  There are too many clothing brands to choose from for me to be willing to deal with dishonest companies.\n",

As soon as I received the confirmation, I realized they were sending the shirts to my address instead of his in Saratoga Springs, NY.  I called immediately and they told me they could not change the address....it was too late and would not let me cancel the order so I could reorder using the right address.  How could it be too late when I called a few minutes after I hit the place order button?  I talked to a manager as well who could care less that it was going to the wrong address.  I've used BR for years, but no more!  They have the worst customer service I've ever seen.  Buyers beware!!!\n",

      "Review: On 4/23/23, I ordered one (1) dress from the Banana Republic website. The total after taxes was $210 and change. I agreed to purchase the ONE (1) dress for $210 and change and I went through the entire payment process and received a confirmation for that amount. Next thing I know, I have a confirmation for ELEVEN (11) items for $1,240.83. Instead of ordering the one BR dress, the checkout process somehow glitched and the dress was never ordered (even though I got a confirmation). Instead, it ordered and charged everything that happened to be sitting in my Athleta shopping cart. What is going on, BR? That was a fraudulent charge that I never approved!I called customer service and waited on hold for a good bit. The lady was courteous, but told me things like, \"Well, maybe in the future don't leave things in your carts because from our end it's tied together\" or something like that. I don't care if it is tied together on their end -- from the user experience side of things they are different URLs, different shopping carts, and different checkout processes. She was able to cancel the fraudulent transaction and was working on getting the dress I ordered to me when the call was, of course, disconnected. Shameful, Banana Republic et al. Do better!

Second box was in the mailroom and didn’t realize it so I was ready to return. I caught COVID and couldn’t leave the house until I tested negative so I could not physically go in to UPS nor the store to do so… I got 5 days late of their 30 day window(this is from the date on when items where shipped from their warehouse and not when the shipment arrived at your doorstep) I couldn’t get a one time courtesy to be able to return unused, and the unopened shipper box as their policy is NO EXCEPTION EVEN IF YOURE IN THE BRINK OF DEATH! Dramatic? Yes, but this company shows NO COMPASSION WHATSOEVER! $1,163 down the drain as the items ordered doesn’t fit me right since keeping it seems to be the only option.

I have purchased a pair of black dress pants from BR early this year and started wearing them to work just now. Guess what, they have stained everything they touched black. My skin, my office chair, my white silk top and my purse. Great! A pair of cheap, $70 pants ruined everything they touched. BR's quality product went dramatically down in the last 10 years and this was the last straw. I will never purchase from them again. There are other clothing companies out there that have respect for the customers and stand behind the quality of what they sell. Like Club Monaco for instance. I'd rather pay more and buy less and save myself the frustration by dealing with BR's garbage clothing.\n",

I called them again July 19th, another lady offered to do a 1-day shipping. She cancelled my first order and did a re-ship. I was ecstatic!

Called them and another lady told me I'll get my original order and that it's not cancelled, there's just no ETA. So my original shipment is still waiting in the back of a truck, possibly cancelled with how unreliable the info relayed has been, and the 1-day shipping was just for show. I've been extremely patient for 2 months, politely checking in and all on the status of a pair of earrings that I've been eyeing for months before buying the moment they went on a good sale. I don't mind waiting, but the lack of information and updates on my item ordered 2 months ago, and a useless re-ship, has me questioning the quality of customer service they provide. I know we're in a pandemic, but even items coming from the other side of the world make it to me within a month and customer service always KNOWS where my items are. The lack of organization is appalling. I'd understand if they were shipping with Canada Post, but they're shipping with UPS. Baffling and disappointing.\n",

The hinges on the frames were very cheaply constructed and the lenses were loose inside the frames.  Upon processing a return I was quite disappointed to find that I would not be reimbursed for the shipping amount.  Should of gone with an A Prime purchase like usual I guess.  Then the true madness of BR hit me.  15 days after returning the product, I received it back to my mailbox...in a packaging mess of ripped plastic and tape and labels all over.  Upon contacting BR to find out why it was shipped back to me, they said that receiving staff found there to be no issue with the product so it was returned to me.  What???  They will not accept my return of a brand new unused product, minus the shipping cost argument???  What is this place?  Customer service (Christina B) told me to file a dispute through my bank transaction, so that is what I will do.  Not for the money but for the principle of the matter.

      "Review: I went on vacation with a new Banana Republic shirt I received as a gift for Christmas. I had worn and washed it ONCE. When I went to put it on, I found a hole in the front and another where the seams meet under the arm. With airline weight restrictions these days, I of course threw it out rather than carry a worthless item home. I tried contacting them first through fb (no response) then Twitter.  BR responded to that, although by their response, it's obvious why 99% of their 211 reviews on Consumer Affairs are 1 star, with just two 2 star and ZERO 3, 4 or 5 star. Their response was - since you threw the xmas present top away, you're basically $%&^ out of luck. Truly pathetic customer service. I was never expecting a refund of the purchase price since I didn't have the shirt as evidence. But, there are a handful of things they could do ~ that cost them nothing! ~ to retain customer loyalty and goodwill, and actually bring people back to the store AND make them money, but they've gone so far downhill they don't even see that. And for that reason, neither I, nor my sister who bought the shirt, will shop there again.They really need to pay attention to their Consumer Affairs, Trust Pilot and Better Business Bureau reviews, then evaluate their policies and do something to revamp their awful customer (dis)service. They are really bad at this! They should be embarrassed by the reviews they have received. Is there not a director of the customer service department who cares about Banana Republic's image? They go so far as to blame the customer for their inability to resolve customer issues! On BBB, they always answer complaints with this ridiculous line, \"(we) are disappointed that you felt the need to reach out to a third party in pursuit of a resolution.\" They should rather be disappointed in their own customer service reps and sales associates who do nothing to retain customers due to the time consuming, horrible policies that they have in place. They'd rather argue with the customer, go back and forth in emails or DMs, or spend hours on the phone - costing them far more in employee salaries than the cost of fixing the issue would.  Truly 95% of their complaints have an easy resolution that would cost them nothing or next to nothing. But I guess they must enjoy seeing all these hundreds of terrible reviews, that not only lose them that customer and her/his family and friends, but also anyone who might read the review and see how awful Banana Republic treats its customers.\n",

      "Review: I've had a long-standing relationship with Banana Republic, being a loyal customer for decades and even holding an ICON membership. Over the years, I estimate I've spent well over $20,000 with them. However, my recent experience with their online service was deeply disappointing.I placed an order for six items through their website, but upon delivery, three items were missing. When I reached out to customer service, I was informed that one missing item could be refunded immediately, but for the other two, I needed to file an online claim.Following their instructions, I promptly filed the claim that evening. To my surprise, the next morning, I received an email stating that my claim had been denied without explanation. Frustrated, I called customer service again seeking clarification. Instead of assistance, I was advised to dispute the charges with my credit card company (which happens to be a Banana Republic card).This response was incredibly frustrating. I was essentially being asked to resolve an issue that was clearly Banana Republic's responsibility. To escalate the matter, I contacted the customer service number on the back of my Banana Republic card and was directed to the dispute department. Throughout our conversation, I was repeatedly reminded that the call was being recorded, and I was informed that resolving the issue could take up to two billing cycles.This entire ordeal has left me thoroughly dissatisfied. Banana Republic's handling of the situation has been unprofessional and burdensome. As a result, once I've redeemed the rewards points I've accumulated, I'll be closing my Banana Republic card. This experience has soured my longstanding relationship with the brand.\n",

      "Review: Buyer beware, Banana Republic may not refund you for your returns as they believe it is a courtesy to do so. They are also the rudest company I have ever dealt with and refuse to apologize for their shortcomings. Overall Banana Republic offered me the worst customer service that I have ever experienced and they seem to think it’s not important.I had to return two shirts as they were too big. I went into the returns section on their website and they sent me the shipping label. I returned the product using the shipping label they provided and I have tracking of the product saying it was delivered. I emailed the company after a couple of weeks querying the delay with the refund. Approx one month later Banana Republic emailed me to say that they could not see the details of where it was delivered in the UK but out of courtesy they would issue a refund. Out of courtesy! I explained that this was not an issue of courtesy and that I had followed their returns directions and used the shipping label that they provided so if there were any issues with the delievery then that was their problem with the shipping company. It is not a courtesy get your money back when you follow the companies own procedure! I would liken Banana Republic to scam artists based on this.They also do not forward complaints to senior managers despite several requests to do so; or else the senior managers are just as clueless and horrible.If I were you I would avoid Banana Republic altogether they are obviously unprofessional, rude and don’t understand their obligations or their responsibilities. More importantly they may not refund you for your returns!Please be careful of Banana Republic, the dodgiest purchasing experience I have ever had to endure.\n",

      "Title: Shame on Banana Republic Corporate!\n",
      "Review: It appears that Banana Republic Corporate is falling short of ensuring consumers are recipients of quality, knowledgable, respectful, and supportive customer service.  I returned an item within 24 hours of my receipt using the company's prepaid shipping label.  Unfortunately, the shipment was apparently lost in transit.  Although I provided Banana Republic with a copy of my UPS receipt validating my (prompt) return of the item, the company refused to issue a refund until the lost shipment was located and / or a claim was submitted.  I informed both the representative and supervisor that this issue was between Banana Republic and their 'contracted shipper' and does not involve the customer.  Further, I asserted that their refusal to issue my refund due to a problem with their shipper is a violation of my consumer rights.  However, PayPal issued my rightful and long overdue refund immediately following the initiation of a dispute claim.  Sadly, Banana Republic's continuing pattern of numerous negative online reviews is indicative of their failure to micromanage staff training, their level of knowledge specific to policies and consumer rights, and personable customer service skills.  Shame on Banana Republic Corporate for their role in allowing customers to be victim to such substandard customer service!\n",
